Welcome to the 2021 Wrap-Up. With the pandemic continuing through a second year, it felt a lot more like an extended 2020 to many of us. The city continued with many of the adaptations we began the prior year. Years of good fiscal management allowed us to piece together a reduced budget without cutting services or programs, despite major revenue losses associated with COVID (hotels, in particular). Challenges lie ahead, but our commitment to finding solutions in partnership with the community are as strong as ever.

Since being first elected in 2016, I have published this annual wrap-up as one way of providing transparency and accountability for the council's work to the Emeryville community. The five categories I track are tied to my original campaign promises to the Emeryville community.

As a reminder, if you’d like to check our progress over the past four years and learn about how the council has moved the city forward on these key issues, you can find prior year wrap-ups here:

**2021 Updates**

1. **_Housing Affordability & Stability_**

I am proud that Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections. Just this past month, [**the SF Chronicle wrote a feature piece about the city's affordable housing practices and policies**](https://www.sfchronicle.com/eastbay/article/The-city-that-is-happy-to-cast-shade-How-16683334.php), and how we are a regional leader on the issue. Thank you to the members of the city council, our fantastic city staff, and you, the community, for helping make us a model community for housing production, preservation, access, and equitability.

* _Measure C Affordable Housing Bond Expenditure Plan:_ Over the past couple years, city staff, the resident Housing Committee, the resident Budget Advisory Committee, and the City Council have been developing a long-term expenditure plan to preserve and produce affordable housing for our city. We opted to integrate the bond revenues voters approved in 2018 and roughly $15 million in other housing assets into a comprehensive expenditure plan that will help us continue our good work. The Expenditure Plan was approved this past year. [**You can read the expenditure plan here**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/13878/APPROVED-Resolution-No-21-13?bidId=).
* _4300 San Pablo Avenue_: In 2020, the city council approved exclusive negotiating rights with EAH Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer, [**to construct a 68-unit intergenerational affordable housing project**](http://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/) aimed at seniors and formerly homeless or foster care system-involved youth. In early 2021, EAH Housing reported back that the city's vision of an intergenerational project that served seniors and youth was ineligible for tax credit financing under California law. The City Council sponsored state legislation to amend state law and allow for state financing of intergenerational housing projects. [**Senate Bill 591**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB591), which received bipartisan support and was signed by Governor Newsom, takes effect today, January 1, 2022. This will make our new housing project competitive for state financing, leveraging local dollars the city committed to bring in funding from many other sources, allowing us to build a significant local housing project with financial investment from outside the city. _Below photo: Rendering of future affordable housing at 4300 San Pablo Ave._

  ![Rendering of future Intergenerational Affordable Housing Project at 4300 San Pablo Avenue](https://johnbauters.net/img/eah-san-pablo.jpg)
* _3600 San Pablo Avenue (“The Nellie Hannon Gateway”):_ In 2017, the city council unanimously directed city staff to pursue acquisition of 3600/3610/3620 San Pablo Avenue for the purposes of building permanent supportive housing on the site. In 2019, with the help of a loan from the city, affordable housing developer RCD Housing acquired the site during a bankruptcy proceeding and entered into an agreement with the city for the development of affordable housing. [**The project will contain 90 units**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F) made available to very low income renters, including a number of units that will provide permanent supportive housing to people experiencing homelessness in our community. The ground floor will include a permanent, indoor facility and dining room for [**ECAP**](https://www.ecapprogram.com/), which serves over 200,000 meals annually to low-income seniors and people experiencing homelessness and hunger in Alameda County. The city supported RCD in applying for over $20M in competitive state funding from the Cap-and-Trade Program's Affordable Housing - Sustainable Communities Grant Program. We hope to hear that the project has won competitive state funding any week now. _Below photo: Rendering of future affordable housing at 3600 San Pablo Ave._

![Rendering of future Permanent Supportive Housing at 3600 San Pablo Avenue](https://johnbauters.net/img/rcd-housing.jpg)

* _Sherwin-Williams (“The Emery”):_ Significant progress was made on the 500 units (87 affordable) at the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory site. According to Lennar, the builder, the first two buildings are expected to be ready for new residents by May 2022, with the other two buildings, the new 2 acre city park, dog park, playground, basketball court and community garden being completed by summer 2023. _Below: Rendering of “The Emery,” currently under construction._

![Shewin Williams site rendering](https://johnbauters.net/img/sherwin-williams.jpg)

* _6701 Shellmound (“Nady Site”):_ The long-abandoned Nady property at the Shellmound Street off-ramp was cleared in January 2019 to make way for a new, 186-unit project. The project is under construction and will likely be completed in 2023.
* _3840 Adeline Street ("MAZ Building"):_ The property at the corner of Adeline, MacArthur, and San Pablo Avenues [**that was twice the victim of arson**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/27/emeryville-105-unit-apartment-twice-torched-by-arsonists-to-be-donated-to-uc-berkeley-for-student-housing/) was completed and opened in 2021. Local developer Rick Holliday dedicated all 105 of the units as affordable graduate student housing in a gift to UC Berkeley.
* [**You can check monthly updates on all pending projects in the city at this link.**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/archive.aspx?AMID=40&Type=&ADID=)

2. **_Public Safety_** 

The primary public safety challenge across the Bay Area remains auto burglaries. These tend to opportunize visitors at our local shopping center parking lots in particular. EPD continues to partner with private property commercial owners to implement prevention strategies that help reduce victimization. 

* _Bay Street Improvements:_ Bay Street changed ownership this past year. I have been meeting regularly with their new ownership group, who are very motivated to bring safety enhancements to the project. Look for new lighting, garage security and physical presence at Bay Street in 2022. They are also actively engaged in the development review process to make additional changes to Bay Street that will increase community safety.
* _Fire Safety:_ The city had no significant fire-related calls for service in 2021.

3. **_Parks, Open Space & Environmentalism_**

The city is a regional leader on environmental issues, and we continue to work toward a more sustainable future that recognizes the importance of our community being part of the climate action solution. Below are a few of the things we were  up to in 2021.

* _Point Emery:_ The city has been looking to save Point Emery from erosion for the past few years. This past summer, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), the agency with jurisdiction over Bay Area shorelines, approved the city's proposal for restoring Point Emery, which will include some new features like a path and bench seating. [**You can review all the documents related to the proposal under agenda item 8 from BCDC's summer meeting**](https://www.bcdc.ca.gov/cm/2021/07-15-agenda.html). Construction will begin on June 15, 2022 and will last 6-8 weeks. _Below: Diagram of improvements coming to Point Emery._

* _Horton Landing Park:_ The Horton Landing Park opened to the public on December 3, 2021 in conjunction with the South Bayfront Bridge _(see below)_. This park is slated to be expanded to the south to include open space and a dog park facility between the east end of the bridge and the north end of the Sherwin Williams development. The Emeryville Greenway will also be completed, extending south to the corner of Sherwin and Halleck Streets. These additional park facilities will be completed in 2023. _Below: Horton Landing Park and newest extension of the Emeryville Greenway._

* _Davenport Park:_ This park had been slated for construction this past year but faced some unexpected challenges. 

![Diagram of Davenport Park Plan](https://johnbauters.net/img/davenport-park.jpg)

* _Playgrounds:_ The city's playgrounds are extremely well-loved by Emeryville children and their friends. The city is aware of the need to replace playground surfacing, update some playground facilities, and we have a goal of adding new playgrounds to parts of the city where none currently exist. For decades, Emeryville approved projects without providing ample ongoing funding for the maintenance of these facilities and others that are of importance to the community. Identifying ongoing funding to assist public works in maintaining parks, playgrounds, and for adding new ones that we can sustain will be a priority for me in 2022.
* _Tree Survey:_ At the December 21, 2021 Council Meeting, I requested a future agenda item to discuss conducting a citywide tree survey. The city can and should identify opportunities to expand our street and private tree canopy, coordinate treewell enhancement/replacement with sidewalk work/repairs, and seek funding to better maintain our natural resource assets. Look for this to be part of a comprehensive discussion alongside park and playground maintenance in 2022. _Below: New street trees being planted along Sherwin Avenue in conjunction with the "Emery" housing project._

  ![](/img/img_6853.jpg)
* _Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD):_ I have represented Alameda County's cities on the nine-county [**Bay Area Air Quality Management District**](https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/board-of-directors) Board of Directors since 2018. Over the past year, the Board has considered amendments to Rule 6-5, which regulates particulate matter emissions from Bay Area refineries. As chair of the committee that oversees refinery regulation, I spent hundreds of hours working to pass the most health-protective standard for emissions regulation _anywhere in the world_. Hundreds of Bay Area residents gave public testimony over the multi-day hearing on the rule, including many Emeryville residents. [**You can read KQED's feature story about the historic adoption of Rule 6-5 here.**](https://www.kqed.org/news/11876301/bay-area-refineries-must-dramatically-cut-pollution-air-district-says-in-historic-vote) The Board of Directors nominated and selected me to serve as Vice Chair of the Board for 2022, where I look to continue our good work in approving emissions-control regulations that protect air quality and public health.
* _COP 26:_ I had the privilege of attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November. [**You can read about my experience in my most recent post.**](https://johnbauters.net/2021/11/21/cop26-the-relationship-between-nature-mental-health/)

4. **_Transportation Infrastructure_** 

A lot of wonderful things happened again in the transportation infrastructure space, despite 2020’s best efforts to ruin everything.

* _South Bayfront Bridge:_ After decades of community input, a protracted legal battle over redevelopment financing with the state, design challenges from the UPRR and some delays for railing fabrication, the bicycle-pedestrian [**South Bayfront Bridge**](http://www.biggscardosa.com/home/index.php/projects/transportation/pedestrian-bicycle/south-bayfront-pedestrian-bicycle-bridge) opened to the public on December 3, 2021. The construction of the approaches and the Horton Landing Park will continue, with the anticipated opening date in fall of 2021. _Below: Photo of South Bayfront Bridge installation._
* _COVID Slow Streets/Your New Doyle Street Greenway:_ When the pandemic began, cities looked for ways to create safe outdoor spaces for people to exercise while practicing adequate social distancing. In Emeryville, the [**Transportation Committee**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/110/Transportation-Committee) recommended that we convert parts of Doyle Street into protected active transportation space. The result was extremely popular with residents and the council received overwhelmingly positive feedback. In October, the Alameda County Transportation Commission put out $75,000 “quick-build” grants for cities that wanted to make permanent bike/ped changes. We leaped on the opportunity to make permanent improvements to Doyle Street. The result is a fully separated bike/ped space, coupled with street closures at both ends. We hope you ❤️ it as much as we do! _Below: Photo of Doyle Street, looking north from 61st Street. New permanent bollards and planters will close off portions of this street permanently to cars in the coming days._

  ![](https://johnbauters.net/img/doyle-street.jpeg)
* _San Pablo Avenue Corridor Plan:_ The county continues to work with the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and AC Transit to design and implement a new vision for the San Pablo Avenue Corridor. Based on public surveys and other studies conducted over the past two years, the county anticipates rolling out a first phase of changes to the Oakland and Emeryville segments of San Pablo in the next couple years, with BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) lanes and protected bike lanes. [**You can learn more about the project here**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/multimodal-arterial-roads/sanpabloave/).
* _Horton & 59th Street Bike Lane Extensions:_ As part of our annual repaving program, we installed new bollards on our existing protected bike lanes, and extended them up to 62nd Street, while also putting parking-protected bike lanes along 59th Street between Hollis and Horton. Our goal is to continue making these kinds of improvements on the city’s bike network going forward as part of already-scheduled paving plans the city has.
* _Quiet Zones/Safe Railroad Crossings:_ For years I have heard from residents about the challenges posed by the train horns in Emeryville. In 2018, the city competed for and won a State CTC Grant of SB 1 funding to help bring much needed safety improvements that would also allow us to create a federally-designated quiet zone. So many of you were instrumental in that effort - thank you! The UPRR has recently signed off on the final design elements and the state is expected to release our grant money to us in January 2021 with construction anticipated to begin in summer 2021. [**Learn more about the project here.**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/05/01/updates-rail-safety-quiet-zone-funding-south-bayfront-bridge-progress-parking-management-plan/)
* _Ashby Interchange:_ The [**Ashby Interchange Project**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/highway-improvement/i-80-ashby-avenue-sr-13-interchange-improvements/) project will begin its final design phase this coming year. The original rotary-style off-ramps have been removed in favor of a tight diamond design. The project will include a new bicycle-pedestrian crossing from Emeryville to the Bay Trail, with a vista park on the marina side of the freeway. Construction is estimated to begin in early 2023 after right-of-way entitlements and other legal approvals are completed in 2022, following final design approval.
* _Alameda CTC:_ As Emeryville’s representative to the [**Alameda County Transportation Commission**](https://www.alamedactc.org/), I was humbled to be elected the Vice Chair of the Commission in January 2020. This leadership position is traditionally two, one-year terms. I work closely with Commission Chair and Mayor of San Leandro, Pauline Cutter, as well as the 20 other representatives to the Commission in guiding the transportation policies, projects, programs and investments for Alameda County. I am very proud of the incredible work we do here in Emeryville on Transportation and Public Works, and have special gratitude for our Public Works staff, city manager, and Councilmember Medina who work closely with me in helping make Emeryville a safe, livable, and accessible community for people of all ages, incomes and abilities.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #5_

**_Small Business_** _– An important element of livability comes from supporting small, local-serving businesses that give our community character. I would like us to leverage the fees gathered from the development process to help us support and grow small business._

_2020 Progress on Priority #5_

The COVID pandemic has been particularly harsh on our small business economy this past year. I’ve spent countless hours working with our local small businesses to make our small, nimble city adaptive and responsive to the needs of businesses trying to weather the pandemic and its economic impact. The city council acted unanimously and decisively on a number of initiatives this year, which have helped bridge many of our local businesses into 2021. We have more work to do, but to date our actions have included the following:

* _Small Business Eviction Moratorium & Rental Repayment:_ In May, the city council passed a series of urgency ordinances to protect small businesses. Among these, the city council put an eviction moratorium in place for restaurants, while also adopting [**a repayment ordinance**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13131/20-019-_-COVID-19-Commercial-Food-Establishment-Urgency-Ordinance-_-Adopted?bidId=) that requires commercial property owners to offer extended periods of at least 12 months for businesses to catch up on late rent payments. Subsequent to the city’s eviction moratorium, [**Governor Newsom signed Executive Order N-80-20**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13209/92320-EO-N-80-20-COVID-19-signed?bidId=) on September 23rd, which put a statewide moratorium on commercial evictions through March 31, 2021.
* _Small Biz Emergency Grants:_ In June, the city council reprogrammed approximately $200,000 of Small Business funding that typically goes toward facade grants into grants for businesses impacted by the looting that took place in late May. The city provided money to over 30 impacted local businesses. We also approved a parklet program to allow restaurants interested in doing outdoor dining a chance to expedite their process and waive normal processing fees. A number of businesses took advantage of that program. In October, we extended it to include other businesses and offered temporary use permits. Thank you to our Community Development Department staff for being so nimble and responsive during these often chaotic times. _Below: The new outdoor dining parklet at one of my favorite breakfast spots: Doyle Street Cafe._

![Doyle Street Cafe Parklet](https://johnbauters.net/img/doyle-street-cafe.jpg)

* _Delivery Fee Ordinance:_ In October, the city council adopted [**an urgency ordinance that capped the cost of food-service delivery fees**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13255/APPROVED-Urgency-Ordinance-No-20-023---delivery-fee-cap?bidId=). Emeryville was joined by a number of other east bay cities in regulating delivery companies that were gouging delivery prices. The ordinance is set to continue for 180 days after the state of emergency ends, giving the council time to consider a permanent ordinance.
* _Small Biz Financial Aid Program:_ In November, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors announced a small business assistance program to provide grants to businesses impacted by COVID. To incentivize local participation in the program, a portion of the funds were dedicated on a first-come, first-serve basis to city’s who matched the grant amounts. The city council acted quickly, putting up $115,000 as match funding, moving Emeryville’s businesses to the front of the line for the county’s contribution. A list of awardees is expected soon.
* You can find a comprehensive resource on federal, state, and local resources for businesses on our city’s website [**by visiting us here**](http://www.emeryville.org/1365/COVID-19-BUSINESS-RESOURCES).

_2021 Emeryville City Council_

![](https://johnbauters.net/img/council-2021.png)Normally, this is where I post the annual photo of the Emeryville City Council taken at our December meeting after we have reorganized to select our new Mayor and Vice Mayor for the following year. Because we have met remotely all year, that group picture was not taken, so I have shared our city website’s council reorg photo instead. Congratulations to my colleagues Dianne Martinez for being selected to serve as our city’s Mayor and Scott Donahue for being selected as Vice Mayor for 2021. Congratulations to Councilmember Patz for completing a challenging year as Emeryville’s Mayor. [**You can learn more about the members of the Emeryville City Council here.**](http://www.emeryville.org/382/Council-Members) The city will be updating this page in early 2021 to contain additional information about council committee assignments, roles, and other functions to help better connect you with your elected representatives on the issues important to you.
