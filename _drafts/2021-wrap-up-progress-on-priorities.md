title: '2021 Wrap-Up: Progress on Priorities'

---
![https://johnbauters.net/img/council-2021.png](https://johnbauters.net/img/council-2021.png "2021 Emeryville City Council")Welcome to the 2021 Wrap-Up. The pandemic continued for a second full year, but the emergency actions the council took in 2020 to protect residents and small businesses proved successful lifelines for many community members through the very tough, early days of the pandemic. The city continues to face fiscal challenges as hotel tax receipts remain way below pre-pandemic levels. Challenges remain, but we will work with the community as we always have to overcome together.

I have done this annual wrap-up to provide additional opportunities for transparency and accountability to the Emeryville community for the work I do as one of your council members. Since I was elected in 2016, I have reported updates on the campaign promises I made every year, with links to articles, reports, and data on these items. As a reminder, you can review each prior year's wrap-up here:

[**2017 Wrap-Up: Priorities on Progress**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/closing-out-2017-progress-on-priorities/)

2021 was the first year of my second term as your councilmember. During my first team, I tracked our action on my five original campaign promises. Going forward, I will continue to track our work on these issues, while expanding them to be inclusive of other things residents have identified as important to the community over the past four years. The five categories are:

* _Housing Affordability & Stability_
* _Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_
* _Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_
* _Community Safety & Wellness_
* _Small Business, Economic Development & Finance_

**_Housing Affordability & Stability_**

Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections. Just this past month, the SF Chronicle wrote a feature piece about the city's affordable housing practices and policies, and how we have emerged as a leader on the issue of affordable housing. [**If you missed that story, you can find it here.**]()

* _Measure C Affordable Housing Bond Expenditure Plan:_ Over the past couple years, city staff, the resident Housing Committee, the resident Budget Advisory Committee, and the City Council have been developing an expenditure plan to preserve and produce affordable housing for our city. We opted to integrate the bond revenues voters approved in 2018 and roughly $15 million in other housing assets into a comprehensive expenditure plan that will help us continue our good work. The Expenditure Plan was approved this past year. [**You can read the expenditure plan here**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/13878/APPROVED-Resolution-No-21-13?bidId=).
* _4300 San Pablo Avenue_: In 2020, the city council approved exclusive negotiating rights with EAH Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer, [**to construct a 68-unit intergenerational affordable housing project**](http://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/) aimed at seniors and formerly homeless or foster care system-involved youth. In early 2021, EAH Housing reported back that the city's vision of an intergenerational project that served seniors and youth was in jeopardy of being realized because California tax credit laws prohibited financing for this type of project. The City Council sponsored state legislation to amend the existing law, allowing for state tax credit financing of intergenerational housing projects. [**Senate Bill 591**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/27/emeryville-105-unit-apartment-twice-torched-by-arsonists-to-be-donated-to-uc-berkeley-for-student-housing/), which received bipartisan support and was [**signed by Governor Newsom in September**](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/politics/newsom-signs-27-housing-bills/103-f7d49e87-2cb4-4437-8e17-2c5a019aa09e), takes effect today, January 1, 2022. This will make our new housing project competitive for state financing, leveraging local dollars the city has committed, bringing in state resources to build the project, ensuring we build much-needed affordable housing for our community. _Below photo: Rendering of future intergenerational affordable housing at 4300 San Pablo Ave._

  ![Rendering of future Intergenerational Affordable Housing Project at 4300 San Pablo Avenue](https://johnbauters.net/img/eah-san-pablo.jpg)
* _3600 San Pablo Avenue (“The Nellie Hannon Gateway”):_ The city partnered with RCD Housing to acquire the site during a bankruptcy proceeding in 2019 and entered into an agreement for the development of affordable housing. [**The project will contain 90 units**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F) made available to very low income renters, including a number of units that will provide permanent supportive housing to people experiencing homelessness in our community. The ground floor will include a permanent, indoor facility and dining room for [**ECAP**](https://www.ecapprogram.com/), which serves over 200,000 meals annually to low-income seniors and people experiencing homelessness and hunger in Alameda County. The project has been approved and an application for building permits was filed in November 2021. The city supported an application for competitive state funding through the Affordable Housing - Sustainable Communities Grant Program. Notice of whether the project will receive as much as $20M in awarded state funds is expected in January 2022.  _Below photo: Rendering of future affordable housing at 3600 San Pablo Ave._

![Rendering of future Permanent Supportive Housing at 3600 San Pablo Avenue](https://johnbauters.net/img/rcd-housing.jpg)

* _Sherwin-Williams (“The Emery”):_ Significant progress was made on the 500 units (87 affordable) at the former Sherwin-Williams paint factory site. The first two buildings are expected to be ready for new residents by May 2022, with the other two buildings, the new 2 acre city park, dog park, playground, basketball court and community garden expected to be completed in summer 2023. _Below: Rendering of “The Emery,” currently under construction._

![Shewin Williams site rendering](https://johnbauters.net/img/sherwin-williams.jpg)

* _6701 Shellmound (“Nady Site”):_ The long-abandoned Nady property at the Shellmound Street off-ramp was cleared in January 2019 to make way for a new, 186-unit project. The project is under construction and will likely be completed in 2023.
* _MAZ Building:_ This Rick Holliday development at the corner of Adeline, MacArthur and San Pablo Avenues, [**that was twice destroyed by arson**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/27/emeryville-105-unit-apartment-twice-torched-by-arsonists-to-be-donated-to-uc-berkeley-for-student-housing/), was finally completed and opened in 2021. Holliday gifted the building's 105 units to UC Berkeley for use as affordable graduate student housing. 
* _Housing Element:_ All Bay Area cities must update their Housing Element every 8 years. The city has just undertaken the start of the yearlong process for updating the Emeryville Housing Element. [**You can learn about that process, sign up for updates, and review the calendar of events for this process on the city's website.**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1403/2023-2031-Housing-Element)
* [**You can check monthly updates on all pending projects in the city at this link.**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/archive.aspx?AMID=40&Type=&ADID=)

**_Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_**

The city has been busy working to expand and improve open space this past year, with a couple long-awaited projects completed and a couple others approved for work in 2022. 

* _Point Emery:_ For the past few years, the city has been actively working to prevent the loss of Point Emery Park to erosion. In summer 2021, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) approved our proposal for the rehabilitation of Point Emery. [**You can read the entire proposal by using the links under agenda item 8 from BCDC's summer meeting**](https://www.bcdc.ca.gov/cm/2021/07-15-agenda.html). The city has secured funding to deliver this natural resource restoration project. The work will include installing a path and benches at Point Emery. The work will begin June 15, 2022 and take 6-8 weeks. _Below: Diagram of improvements slated for Point Emery in 2022._

  ![](/img/screen-shot-2022-01-01-at-10-48-19-am.png)
* _Horton Landing Park:_ The city opened this park on December 3, 2021 in conjunction with the South Bayfront Bridge _(more below under Transportation)_. This park extends the Emeryville Greenway from Stanford/Horton Streets to the new bridge. By summer 2023 the Greenway will be completed down to Sherwin & Halleck Streets. Horton Landing Park will have a new dog park facility added to it in 2023 as well between the east end of the bridge and the north end of the _Emery_ housing development. _Below: Horton Landing Park._ 

  ![](/img/img_6959.jpg)
* _Davenport Park:_ The city faced some logistical delays with the development of this new playground on the Emeryville peninsula near Trader Vic's. The construction bidding package has been approved for release and we hope to receive approval from BCDC to construct this new playground in 2022. _Below: Image of layout for Davenport Park (please note that the bottom of the photo is north)._

![Diagram of Davenport Park Plan](https://johnbauters.net/img/davenport-park.jpg)

* _Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD):_ I have had the honor of serving as the Alameda County cities' representative to the nine-county [**Bay Area Air Quality Management District**](https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/board-of-directors) since 2018. This past year, as chair of the committee that oversees refinery regulation, we adopted the most stringent particulate matter emissions regulation _in the world_ following months of public workshops and multiple days of testimony at public hearing. [**You can read about the historic vote on Rule 6-5 via this KQED story. **](https://www.kqed.org/news/11876301/bay-area-refineries-must-dramatically-cut-pollution-air-district-says-in-historic-vote)Thank you to the many Emeryville residents who participated in the process. The Board of Directors has elected me to serve as Vice Chair of the Board in 2022. I look forward to advancing more health-first air quality regulations in the coming year.
* _Alameda County Healthy Homes Department:_ I have represented the City of Emeryville on the County's Lead Poisoning Prevention Board of Directors since taking office in 2016. As a reminder, if you live in pre-1978 housing, your home may contain lead paint, which is toxic to human health, but especially children's neurological development. You can request free lead testing from this agency. [**Please visit this website if you'd like to have us come test your house for lead risks.**](https://www.achhd.org/index.htm)

**_Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_**

A lot of wonderful things happened again in the transportation infrastructure space, despite 2020’s best efforts to ruin everything.

* _South Bayfront Bridge:_ In the early morning hours of December 20th, the long-awaited bicycle-pedestrian [**South Bayfront Bridge**](http://www.biggscardosa.com/home/index.php/projects/transportation/pedestrian-bicycle/south-bayfront-pedestrian-bicycle-bridge), that will connect the final, southern segment of the Emeryville Greenway across the Union Pacific Railroad was installed. The construction of the approaches and the Horton Landing Park will continue, with the anticipated opening date in fall of 2021. _Below: Photo of South Bayfront Bridge installation._

  ![](https://johnbauters.net/img/bridge.jpeg)
* _COVID Slow Streets/Your New Doyle Street Greenway:_ When the pandemic began, cities looked for ways to create safe outdoor spaces for people to exercise while practicing adequate social distancing. In Emeryville, the [**Transportation Committee**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/110/Transportation-Committee) recommended that we convert parts of Doyle Street into protected active transportation space. The result was extremely popular with residents and the council received overwhelmingly positive feedback. In October, the Alameda County Transportation Commission put out $75,000 “quick-build” grants for cities that wanted to make permanent bike/ped changes. We leaped on the opportunity to make permanent improvements to Doyle Street. The result is a fully separated bike/ped space, coupled with street closures at both ends. We hope you ❤️ it as much as we do! _Below: Photo of Doyle Street, looking north from 61st Street. New permanent bollards and planters will close off portions of this street permanently to cars in the coming days._

  ![](https://johnbauters.net/img/doyle-street.jpeg)
* _San Pablo Avenue Corridor Plan:_ The county continues to work with the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and AC Transit to design and implement a new vision for the San Pablo Avenue Corridor. Based on public surveys and other studies conducted over the past two years, the county anticipates rolling out a first phase of changes to the Oakland and Emeryville segments of San Pablo in the next couple years, with BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) lanes and protected bike lanes. [**You can learn more about the project here**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/multimodal-arterial-roads/sanpabloave/).
* _Horton & 59th Street Bike Lane Extensions:_ As part of our annual repaving program, we installed new bollards on our existing protected bike lanes, and extended them up to 62nd Street, while also putting parking-protected bike lanes along 59th Street between Hollis and Horton. Our goal is to continue making these kinds of improvements on the city’s bike network going forward as part of already-scheduled paving plans the city has.
* _Quiet Zones/Safe Railroad Crossings:_ For years I have heard from residents about the challenges posed by the train horns in Emeryville. In 2018, the city competed for and won a State CTC Grant of SB 1 funding to help bring much needed safety improvements that would also allow us to create a federally-designated quiet zone. So many of you were instrumental in that effort - thank you! The UPRR has recently signed off on the final design elements and the state is expected to release our grant money to us in January 2021 with construction anticipated to begin in summer 2021. [**Learn more about the project here.**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/05/01/updates-rail-safety-quiet-zone-funding-south-bayfront-bridge-progress-parking-management-plan/)
* _Ashby Interchange:_ The [**Ashby Interchange Project**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/highway-improvement/i-80-ashby-avenue-sr-13-interchange-improvements/) project will begin its final design phase this coming year. The original rotary-style off-ramps have been removed in favor of a tight diamond design. The project will include a new bicycle-pedestrian crossing from Emeryville to the Bay Trail, with a vista park on the marina side of the freeway. Construction is estimated to begin in early 2023 after right-of-way entitlements and other legal approvals are completed in 2022, following final design approval.
* _Alameda CTC:_ As Emeryville’s representative to the [**Alameda County Transportation Commission**](https://www.alamedactc.org/), I was humbled to be elected the Vice Chair of the Commission in January 2020. This leadership position is traditionally two, one-year terms. I work closely with Commission Chair and Mayor of San Leandro, Pauline Cutter, as well as the 20 other representatives to the Commission in guiding the transportation policies, projects, programs and investments for Alameda County. I am very proud of the incredible work we do here in Emeryville on Transportation and Public Works, and have special gratitude for our Public Works staff, city manager, and Councilmember Medina who work closely with me in helping make Emeryville a safe, livable, and accessible community for people of all ages, incomes and abilities.

**_Small Business, Economic Development & Finance_** 

The COVID pandemic has been particularly harsh on our small business economy this past year. I’ve spent countless hours working with our local small businesses to make our small, nimble city adaptive and responsive to the needs of businesses trying to weather the pandemic and its economic impact. The city council acted unanimously and decisively on a number of initiatives this year, which have helped bridge many of our local businesses into 2021. We have more work to do, but to date our actions have included the following:

* _Small Business Eviction Moratorium & Rental Repayment:_ In May, the city council passed a series of urgency ordinances to protect small businesses. Among these, the city council put an eviction moratorium in place for restaurants, while also adopting [**a repayment ordinance**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13131/20-019-_-COVID-19-Commercial-Food-Establishment-Urgency-Ordinance-_-Adopted?bidId=) that requires commercial property owners to offer extended periods of at least 12 months for businesses to catch up on late rent payments. Subsequent to the city’s eviction moratorium, [**Governor Newsom signed Executive Order N-80-20**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13209/92320-EO-N-80-20-COVID-19-signed?bidId=) on September 23rd, which put a statewide moratorium on commercial evictions through March 31, 2021.
* _Small Biz Emergency Grants:_ In June, the city council reprogrammed approximately $200,000 of Small Business funding that typically goes toward facade grants into grants for businesses impacted by the looting that took place in late May. The city provided money to over 30 impacted local businesses. We also approved a parklet program to allow restaurants interested in doing outdoor dining a chance to expedite their process and waive normal processing fees. A number of businesses took advantage of that program. In October, we extended it to include other businesses and offered temporary use permits. Thank you to our Community Development Department staff for being so nimble and responsive during these often chaotic times. _Below: The new outdoor dining parklet at one of my favorite breakfast spots: Doyle Street Cafe._

![Doyle Street Cafe Parklet](https://johnbauters.net/img/doyle-street-cafe.jpg)

* _Delivery Fee Ordinance:_ In October, the city council adopted [**an urgency ordinance that capped the cost of food-service delivery fees**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13255/APPROVED-Urgency-Ordinance-No-20-023---delivery-fee-cap?bidId=). Emeryville was joined by a number of other east bay cities in regulating delivery companies that were gouging delivery prices. The ordinance is set to continue for 180 days after the state of emergency ends, giving the council time to consider a permanent ordinance.
* _Small Biz Financial Aid Program:_ In November, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors announced a small business assistance program to provide grants to businesses impacted by COVID. To incentivize local participation in the program, a portion of the funds were dedicated on a first-come, first-serve basis to city’s who matched the grant amounts. The city council acted quickly, putting up $115,000 as match funding, moving Emeryville’s businesses to the front of the line for the county’s contribution. A list of awardees is expected soon.
