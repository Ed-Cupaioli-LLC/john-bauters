title: Emeryville Measure O, Transportation, Housing & Environmental Updates

---
Hi E'villains!

I hope you have had a wonderful summer and are ready for an exciting fall season full of fun! This post is full of exciting updates and information on the progress of important city projects, updates on recent and upcoming events, and details on a very important city ballot measure on the November 8th ballot.

**EMERYVILLE MEASURE O**

There is a _local_ ballot measure for Emeryville voters to consider this year. [Emeryville Measure O](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1443/Measure-O---Real-Property-Transfer-Tax) modifies the city's existing Real Property Transfer Tax ("RPTT"). Emeryville voters overwhelmingly approved the RPTT in 2014 and the City Council has placed this on the ballot to allow residents to make the rates more equitable, requiring large, commercial property owners to pay their fair share for city services like fire, police, environmental/trash services, public works, and transportation safety. 

The RPTT is a **one-time tax** paid **only when a property is sold**. This is _not_ an annual tax or property tax.

**_Under Measure O, there will be NO CHANGE to the tax rate for properties that sell for less than $1 million. This excludes almost every single residential property in Emeryville._** 

There will be a small increase in the rate for properties that sell for between $1 million and $2 million. Properties that sell for _more than_ $2 million will see a larger rate increase.

This tiered system is more equitable as it allows the city to collect more revenues when large office buildings or shopping centers change ownership, providing funding for key city services residents currently enjoy without increasing the resident obligation to fund those services.

The city polled the public about several potential measures to help shore up the city's finances in the aftermath of COVID, and residents strongly favored this approach as the best way to help us continue providing excellent city services with little to no impact on residents. The measure was discussed at each of the city's residents advisory committees, and the city council held several study sessions as well. I held a citywide virtual town hall in spring to hear from residents and answer their questions as well. The council considered all this resident and business input before approving Measure O for the November election. 

**RAILROAD SAFETY PROJECT/FEDERAL QUIET ZONE**

The long-awaited project to improve the safety of the city's at-grade street crossings of the Union Pacific Railroad on the north side of the city broke ground in June. [You can now track the timelines, design elements and other info on the Quiet Zone establishment here.](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1136) The construction will include new traffic signals on Hollis and Shellmound, double-armed gates, safety fences and bike/ped improvements. Once completed next year, the city will submit a request to the federal government to create the Quiet Zone that allows train conductors to withhold pulling their horn as they come into our Amtrak Station.
