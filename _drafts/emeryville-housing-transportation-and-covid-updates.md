Happy Spring E'villains,

**COVID Information**

Public Health officials are relaxing some of the restrictions put in place to protect public health during the height of the pandemic, when infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths threatened to exceed the capacities of our health system. Businesses want to reopen and all of us want the opportunity to see family and friends, travel, and enjoy time together - safely. The city temporarily suspended many of the events and programs that bring our community together in response to public health orders this past year. To help reopen businesses and our community, we need everyone to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when the opportunity presents itself.

Beginning April 1st, all Californians **age 50+** are eligible to get vaccinated.

Beginning April 15th, all Californians **age 16+** are eligible to get vaccinated.

For more information on vaccinations and how to receive a notification when you become eligible to make an appointment, please visit:
