Happy Spring E'villains,

**COVID Information**

Public Health officials are relaxing some of the restrictions put in place to protect public health during the height of the pandemic, when infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths threatened to exceed the capacities of our health system. Businesses want to reopen and all of us want the opportunity to see family and friends, travel, and enjoy time together - safely. The city temporarily suspended many of the events and programs that bring our community together in response to public health orders this past year. To help reopen businesses and our community, we need everyone to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when the opportunity presents itself.

Beginning **April 1st**, all Californians **age 50+** are eligible to get vaccinated.

Beginning **April 15th**, all Californians **age 16+** are eligible to get vaccinated.

For more information on vaccinations and how to receive a notification when you become eligible to make an appointment, please visit:

Despite COVID, the city has been very busy with a lot of important projects in development. Here are some of the Transportation updates that residents frequently ask about:

**Union Pacific Safety Improvements/Quiet Zone**

Back in late 2017, with the support of the City Council, I pushed for the city to seek competitive state funding to deliver the long-desired safety improvements. [Residents responded to my call for support](http://johnbauters.net/2018/01/21/city-council-staff-making-push-to-win-funding-for-rail-safety-quiet-zone-improvements/) and later that year our proposed safety improvements for the 65th, 66th and 67th Street railroad crossings
