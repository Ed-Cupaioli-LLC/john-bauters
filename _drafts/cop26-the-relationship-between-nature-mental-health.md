title: COP26, Nature & Mental Health, South Bayfront Bridge, ECAP Holiday Dinner

---
Hello Emeryville Neighbors and Friends. It's been a while since we've had a community update, so I intend to put 2-4 posts out between now and the end of January, capturing important updates on housing, development, transportation and other infrastructure projects around the city and the East Bay, among other things. As always, if you have questions about local happenings, or a subject/topic you would like to suggest for inclusion in a future post, don't hesitate to drop me a note.

**COP 26**

For the past four years, I have served as the Alameda County Conference of Mayors representative to the [Bay Area Air Quality Management District's Board of Directors](https://www.baaqmd.gov/). In that capacity, I have served as the chair of the District's Stationary Source Committee for the past two years, which is responsible for developing and recommending rules and regulations to curb emissions from stationary (non-mobile) sources of pollutant emissions. After more than a year of public hearings, [the District approved Rule 6-5](https://www.kqed.org/news/11876301/bay-area-refineries-must-dramatically-cut-pollution-air-district-says-in-historic-vote), which will require Bay Area refineries to implement new, cleaner technologies that will dramatically reduce pollution. Similarly, [my committee is working on setting new standards to eliminate dangerous NOx emissions](https://www.baaqmd.gov/rules-and-compliance/rules/reg-9-rule-4-nitrogen-oxides-from-fan-type-residential-central-furnaces?rule_version=2021%20Amendment) from home water heaters and furnaces that significantly contribute to global warming and lower air quality in our region. These rules have made the Bay Area a _global_ leader on reducing harmful particulate matter and NOx emissions from the build environment, and something I am extremely proud to be part of on behalf of our city and county. This past week the other Directors from around the Bay Area nominated and elected me to serve as the Vice Chair of the Board in 2022, an honor I'm truly humbled to receive.

Our great work in the Bay Area resulted in an invitation to participate in the global discussion of preventing climate change. Earlier this month, I had the extraordinary opportunity to serve as a member of the United States' subdelegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as [COP 26](https://ukcop26.org/), in Glasgow, Scotland.

During my time in Scotland, I attended panels and workshops presented by experts and leaders from around the globe about how they were tackling a wide array of issues involving everything from transportation and resource conservation to climate equity and community adaptability. I also had the privilege of being part of a panel presentation demonstrating how California generates local climate action through an equity lens. [You can view the hour-long presentation here.](https://vimeo.com/643848000)

I interviewed a number of leaders about their perspectives and experience at COP 26. Those are posted on the Air District's Facebook Page (@bayareaairdistrict) and on their Twitter feed (@AirDistrict). They include interviews with the former chairs of the CA Air Resources and Water Boards (Felicia Marcus, former Water Board Chair is an Emeryville resident!), as well as CA Assembly Transportation Chair Laura Friedman and a 16 year old young woman named Te Maia Wiki, who represented the Yurok Tribe of Northern California at COP 26. I learned so much, and have brought back a lot of ideas for community sustainability, resilience and climate action that I hope to introduce to the community and my colleagues on the city council in the coming year. [The Air District staff created a short summary video of our time at COP 26, which you can view here.](https://app.frame.io/reviews/ed3ba5b0-a6d3-45ed-82c0-eca744925201/e5148b59-e1cb-476d-b41e-ad9ceff33949)

I had the opportunity to meet with local elected officials from around the world to discuss language and amendments for the Glasgow Declaration to ensure that local governments were a meaningful part of the climate change solution.

Fellow Air District representative Davina Hurt and I responded to media inquiries about COP 26 from Glasgow and answered questions about what was going on live in the conference. [That interview is available here on Facebook if you'd like to hear more.](https://fb.watch/9pddbrAfqn/)

Finally, one short story to share about my time at COP 26 came Thursday morning on my walk to the Scottish Event Campus. There were hoards of Scottish school children along the riverfront, donning climate action apparel they had made in class. They were waiting for _Little Amal_, a large, human-operated marionette. Over 4 million people globally will be displaced due to sea level rise and other climate impacts. These are climate refugees. You can learn about _Little Amal_ here - the depiction of a young Syrian climate refugee. The children had lined up to greet her as she finished her global trip from Syria to Scotland. I waited with the first school and met with students and teachers to learn about how they were studying climate change. I was there when _Little Amal_ arrived and filmed the event. We must take our responsibility to be good stewards of the planet seriously to ensure that younger and future generations have the opportunity to live healthy, thriving lives. Enjoy.
