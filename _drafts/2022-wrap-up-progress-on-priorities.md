![https://johnbauters.net/img/council-2021.png](https://johnbauters.net/img/council-2021.png "2021 Emeryville City Council")Welcome to the 2022 Wrap-Up. 

I have done this annual wrap-up to provide additional opportunities for transparency and accountability to the Emeryville community for the work I do as one of your council members. Since I was elected in 2016, I have reported updates on the campaign promises I made every year, with links to articles, reports, and data on these items. As a reminder, you can review each prior year's wrap-up here:

2021 was the first year of my second term as your councilmember. During my first team, I tracked our action on my five original campaign promises. Going forward, I will continue to track our work on these issues, while expanding them to be inclusive of other things residents have identified as important to the community over the past four years. The five categories are:

* _Housing Affordability & Stability_
* _Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_
* _Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_
* _Community Safety & Wellness_
* _Small Business, Economic Development & Finance_
