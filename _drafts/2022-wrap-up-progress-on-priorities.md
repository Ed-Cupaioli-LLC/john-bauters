Welcome to the 2022 Wrap-Up in Emeryville.

Every year since I was elected in 2016, I have provided this annual update on the priorities I identified as a candidate, with links to articles, reports, and data that shows the city's progress on them as a matter of transparency and accountability. Below is the the 2022 wrap-up report. As a reminder, you can review the wrap-up reports for each prior year here:

When I campaigned to serve the Emeryville community on the city council I committed to prioritizing five areas/issues that residents told me were of the greatest importance to them:

* _Housing Affordability & Stability_
* _Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_
* _Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_
* _Community Safety & Wellness_
* _Small Business, Economic Development & Finance_

**_Housing Affordability & Stability_**

Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections. 

_The Christie Sites:_ The city's newest [100% affordable housing project is a three-building, 367-unit project at 5890, 5950 and 6100 Christie Avenue](https://rew-online.com/emeryville-city-council-selects-eah-housing-as-first-choice-developer-for-367-unit-affordable-housing-community/), south of Christie Park and to the west of the Public Market food hall. The project will include an expansion of Christie Park, the inclusion of new athletic/sports courts, addition pedestrian paseos and paths to the Public Market Hall, and after school support programs for students. _Rendition below._

_4300 San Pablo:_ EAH was selected to build this [68-unit intergenerational, affordable housing project](https://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/). 80% of the units will be for low-income seniors, with the other 20% reserved for transition-aged youth (formerly homeless or foster youth). The project is currently securing the necessary construction financing so it can begin construction.

_3600 San Pablo:_ RCD Housing was selected to build this [90-unit affordable housing project for extremely low-income households](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F), including about one-third of the units reserved as permanent, supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness on the current block that serves as the site for [ECAP](https://www.ecapprogram.com/). The project was extremely competitive and successful in competitive funding to match the city's contribution to this project, which has resulted in it being fully financed at this point. The city is working with RCD and ECAP to temporarily relocate the nonprofit during construction, which could begin as early as this spring. ECAP will return, indoors, to the property upon construction being complete.

_"The Emery":_ The former Sherwin-Williams site is slated to be finished in 2023. The first two of the four residential buildings opened to tenants in 2022, with the final two anticipated to welcome new residents this spring. The developer will complete the project this summer by building the remaining southern segment of the Emeryville Greenway, a new city park, playground, dog park, and community organic garden.

_Bayview Apartments:_ The [186-unit apartment building under construction at 6701 Shellmound Street](https://www.amcalhousing.com/amcal/bayview/) is also slated to open in 2023.

_Housing Element:_ Every eight years, all California cities are required to submit a plan to the state for approval, outlining how the city will achieve regionally-mandated housing goals, further Fair Housing initiatives, and promote affordable housing production in their community. The City Council approved the city's 2023-2031 Housing Element for submission to the State of California at the Council Meeting on December 12th after over a year of process through community engagement, resident advisory committees, and council study sessions.
