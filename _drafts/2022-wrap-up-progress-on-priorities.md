Welcome to the 2022 Wrap-Up in Emeryville.

Every year I provide this annual update on the five top priorities I identified as a candidate when I campaigned to be a council member. This annual post contains links to articles, reports, and other data that shows the city's progress on these top priorities. Below is the the 2022 wrap-up report. As a reminder, you can review the wrap-up reports for each prior year here:

When I campaigned to serve the Emeryville community on the city council I committed to prioritizing these five issues that residents told me were of the greatest importance to them:

* _Housing Affordability & Stability_
* _Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_
* _Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_
* _Community Safety & Wellness_
* _Small Business, Economic Development & Finance_

**_Housing Affordability & Stability_**

Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections. Housing production at all levels of income, coupled with housing preservation and [**adequate renter protections**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1127/Eviction-Harassment-Ordinance) are critical to creating a just, equitable, stable, and safe community. With the support of Emeryville voters and their approval of [**2018's Measure C**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1204/Measure-C-Emeryville-Affordable-Housing-), coupled with our [**Affordable Housing Expenditure Plan**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/13878/APPROVED-Resolution-No-21-13?bidId=), the city is producing hundreds of new low-income housing opportunities for families and other vulnerable populations, and [**Emeryville is one of the only cities in the region that has reduced homelessness**](https://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Emeryville-PIT-2022-Infographic-Report.pdf) at a time while overall numbers have grown. The following are updates on some of the projects currently under development.

* _The Christie Sites:_ The city's newest [**100% affordable housing project is a three-building, 367-unit project at 5890, 5950 and 6100 Christie Avenue**](https://rew-online.com/emeryville-city-council-selects-eah-housing-as-first-choice-developer-for-367-unit-affordable-housing-community/), south of Christie Park and to the west of the Public Market food hall. The project will include an expansion of Christie Park, the inclusion of new athletic/sports courts, addition pedestrian paseos and paths to the Public Market Hall, and after school support programs for students. The City Council unanimously selected EAH Housing to be the developer in November and the project will now go through the design and financing process. This project will also receive partial financing in the amount of $20 million from the ownership of the Public Market. Construction is not anticipated until 2025. _Rendition below._

* _4300 San Pablo:_ EAH was selected to build this [**68-unit intergenerational, affordable housing project**](https://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/). 80% of the units will be for low-income seniors, with the other 20% reserved for transition-aged youth (formerly homeless or foster youth). The project is currently securing the necessary construction financing so it can begin construction.
* _3600 San Pablo:_ RCD Housing was selected to build this [**90-unit affordable housing project for extremely low-income households**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F), including about one-third of the units reserved as permanent, supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness on the current block that serves as the site for [**ECAP**](https://www.ecapprogram.com/)**.** The project was extremely competitive and successful in competitive funding to match the city's contribution to this project, which has resulted in it being fully financed at this point. The city is working with RCD and ECAP to temporarily relocate the nonprofit during construction, which could begin as early as this spring. ECAP will return, indoors, to the property upon construction being complete.
* _"The Emery":_ The former Sherwin-Williams site is slated to be finished in 2023. The first two of the four residential buildings opened to tenants in 2022, with the final two anticipated to welcome new residents this spring. The developer will complete the project this summer by building the remaining southern segment of the Emeryville Greenway, a new city park, playground, dog park, and community organic garden.
* _Bayview Apartments:_ The [**186-unit apartment building under construction at 6701 Shellmound Street **](https://www.amcalhousing.com/amcal/bayview/)is also slated to open in 2023.
* _Housing Element:_ Every eight years, all California cities are required to submit a plan to the state for approval, outlining how the city will achieve regionally-mandated housing goals, further Fair Housing initiatives, and promote affordable housing production in their community. The City Council approved the city's 2023-2031 Housing Element for submission to the State of California at the Council Meeting on December 12th after over a year of process through community engagement, resident advisory committees, and council study sessions. [**You can find the final draft element and other information on the Housing Element here.**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1403/2023-2031-Housing-Element)

**_Parks, Open Space & Environmental Issues_**

* _Point Emery:_ With the support of the resident advisory Parks & Recreation Committee, the city worked closely with regional agencies over the past few years to get approval for the restoration of Point Emery. Construction took place between summer and fall to restore shoreline, protect habitat, add an ADA-friendly path and bench seating on the point. We dedicated and reopened Point Emery on December 1st. _Below: photo of Emeryville Sr. Engineer Mike Roberts, Mayor Bauters, Councilmember Martinez (& Chloe!) at the reopening event._

* _Davenport Park:_ The city's first playground on the peninsula is currently under construction just west of the Trader Vic's parking lot. This project, the product of advocacy efforts by parents in our community, will bring geographic equity and play access to residents and visitors of our marina community. The city anticipates opening and dedicating the new playground in February.
* _Bay Area Air Quality Management District:_ Since 2018, I have represented the Alameda County Mayor's Conference at [**BAAQMD**](https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/board-of-directors), the nine-county regional agency responsible for air quality regulation. In that role, I was selected to be a member of the US sub-delegation to the United Nations Climate Conference, [**_COP 27_,**](https://unfccc.int/) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt this past November. I was unanimously selected to serve as Chair of the Air District's Board of Directors in 2023. _Below: Waiting for Secretary of State John Kerry to speak about a clean energy initiative with Mexico at COP 27, with Belmont Councilmember and BAAQMD Vice Chair, Davina Hurt._

* _Urban Forestry:_ This past year, council supported my request to initiate an Urban Tree Study to examine opportunities for us to improve local sustainability, resilience, support our climate action goals, and improve community and neighborhood livability by finding places to add trees within our city. The consultant is currently examining existing opportunities for tree replacement, addition and innovation that will improve the city's tree canopy, with the results expected early this year. I will be asking the council to agree to fund a local program to begin tree planting based on the outcomes of the study.

**_Transportation & Public Works Infrastructure_**

Having completed the long-awaited South Bayfront Bridge in 2021, the city got some new projects underway this past year.

* _Alameda County Transportation Commission:_ In January, I was elected Chair of the [**Alameda CTC**](https://www.alamedactc.org/)**,** the regional agency that plans, funds, and delivers transportation and safety projects across the county. We also serve as the implementing agency for the voter-approved [**Measure BB (2014)**](https://www.alamedactc.org/funding/fund-sources/measure-bb). In that role, I've worked to modify scoring criteria to prioritize funding for projects that reduce injuries and deaths along the county's High-Injury Network. I also undertook an initiative earlier this year to have the agency adopt its first [**Race & Equity Action Plan (REAP)**](https://www.alamedactc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AlamedaCTC_REAP_2022_Final.pdf), which will center our future investments and priorities around racial equity.
* _Quiet Zone/Rail Safety Project:_ In June we broke ground on a project that residents near the city's three at-grade crossings have been hoping to get for close to 40 years. I am extremely excited about this project. Safety improvements that have been shown to reduce the likelihood of safety accidents at rail crossings by 90% will be installed over the next 6 months. Alameda County is ranked 4th in the _nation_ for most dangerous railroad crossings. This project will be a model for other cities across the East Bay that are currently seeking funding to replicate our efforts. Residents will notice new traffic signals and temporary road closures at the rail crossings in January and February 2023 while new lights, gates and fences are installed. Once complete, the city will apply to the federal government for a federally-approved "Quiet Zone" designation, which would authorize conductors to not blow the horn on trains coming through the city, improving livability alongside safety.
