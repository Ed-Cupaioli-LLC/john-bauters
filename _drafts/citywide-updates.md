[The State's Eviction Moratorium is set to expire on March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHIkb0GJkSA). The state law does not permit the city to extend the moratorium beyond the end of this state protection. Tenants who have faced financial challenges during the pandemic should know about several resources and rights they have here in Alameda County and the City of Emeryville:

* The State's COVID-19 Rent Relief Program is open through March 31st. [Please visit this page to apply before the deadline if you qualify for assistance.](https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/#:\~:text=To%20request%20additional%20assistance%2C%20call,at%20833%2D430%2D2122.&text=Are%20you%20a%20landlord%2C%20renter,at%20833%2D430%2D2122.)
* The City of Emeryville has an Eviction Anti-Harassment Ordinance. All tenants in the city are protected under these provisions. [Please know your rights by visiting our city's resource page.](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1127/Eviction-Harassment-Ordinance)
* The city can provide you with information but not legal assistance on private landlord-tenant or foreclosure matters. If you are a low-income household and would like to speak to someone, [Alameda County Housing Secure](https://www.ac-housingsecure.org/?locale=en) can connect you with legal resources and assistance. Please see the website link above or call the agencies on the flyer below for more assistance.

**_Transportation Updates_**

In January, I was elected chair of the [Alameda County Transportation Commission](https://www.alamedactc.org/). Alameda CTC is the agency that oversees local transportation funding, including [Measure BB](https://www.alamedactc.org/funding/fund-sources/measure-bb/), approved by Alameda County voters in 2014. This Wednesday I will host a countywide retreat for commissioners. Among the priorities I will introduce for the coming year, include:

* Creation of a Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (JEDI) Committee to develop a countywide Racial Equity Action Plan to ensure that all contracts, procurements and internal processes are done with attention to racial equity.
* Develop and approve a countywide Bicycle Corridor Network Plan to make the county available for state and federal active transportation funding.
* Prioritize county funding for infrastructure projects that will address existing unsafe conditions in High-Injury areas that have resulted in repeated crashes that harm pedestrians, cyclists, or drivers.
* Integrate the county's transportation mission with regional climate action goals and a clean energy future for commuters and goods movement.

Emeryville will be competing for regional funding this year at Alameda CTC to fund several transportation projects that can make our city safer for walking and cycling, and more reliable for transit. The council will select which projects to submit for funding grants later this spring, with awards to be announced in the fall.

The long-awaited [Railroad Crossing/Quiet Zone project](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/8249/Feasibility-Study-Presentation?bidId=) at 65th/66th/67th Streets will begin this year. Funding was awarded in 2018 but the project was delayed due to objections by the UPRR. Those legal issues have been resolved and the project will begin in a few months.

The California Sustainable Growth Council [awarded the Nellie Hannon Gateway Affordable Housing Project](https://sgc.ca.gov/meetings/council/2022/docs/20220126-Item6_AHSC_Staff_Report.pdf) at 3600 San Pablo Avenue over $20 Million in competitive statewide funding recently. Half of that funding will be used to fund low-income affordable housing units, as well as a permanent location for [ECAP](https://www.ecapprogram.com/). The balance of funds will be used for transit improvements, including construction of the [40th Street Multi-Modal Corridor Project](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1202/40th-and-San-Pablo-Bus-Hub-Concept-Desig). I have had meetings with our state representatives and [sent them a letter on behalf of the city](file:///Users/jbauters/Desktop/Personal%20Docs/Emeryville%20Items/Letters/2022.01.28%20-%2040th%20Street%20Multimodal%20Project%20Budget%20Letter.pdf) seeking their assistance in securing state funding for our local project.
