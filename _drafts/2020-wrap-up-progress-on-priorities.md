title: '2020 WRAP-UP: PROGRESS ON PRIORITIES'

---
Welcome to the 2020 Wrap-Up. 2020 was an unusual year and one that I'm sure many of us would as soon forget. Although we continue to struggle through a global pandemic wrought with ongoing public health and economic challenges, it's more important than ever for public officials and agencies to remain transparent, accessible, and accountable to their communities. Since being first elected in 2016, I have published this annual wrap-up as my way of remaining transparent and accountable to the Emeryville community about the work that we've done on the five policy priority areas I identified as a candidate. Although my near-weekly town halls went on hiatus this year due to COVID, I am still in touch with many of you regularly about issues in our city. You can find the contact information for myself and my council colleagues on [**this city webpage.**](http://emeryville.org/382/Council-Members)

As a reminder, if you’d like to check out the wrap-ups from any of the past three years, you can view each of them here:

[**2017 Wrap-Up: Priorities on Progress**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/closing-out-2017-progress-on-priorities/)

The five priorities I identified when I was a candidate for this office are provided below. The five sections titled _“2016 Campaign Priorities Statement”_ are the top five priorities I provided when asked to provide them as a candidate back in 2016. Below each of them is a section called _“2020 Progress on Priority”_ that summarizes actions taken during 2020 on those same issues I campaigned on.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #1_

**_Housing Affordability & Stability_** _– We must commit to building affordable ownership housing and to providing legal protections for tenants. I will use my expertise on housing programs and policies to help stabilize housing for our resident community. This is my highest priority for the city and it is the most common issue on the minds of residents I’ve spoken with._

_2020 Progress on Priority #1_

Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections.

* _4300 San Pablo Avenue_: In 2019, [**the Emeryville City Council agreed to provide shelter for 20-25 homeless Oakland families with children**](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Why-Emeryville-is-building-a-new-homeless-shelter-14484146.php) at the former Rec Center site, owned by the city. Earlier this year, [**unhoused families with children moved into the site**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oakland-emeryville-partnership-to-shelter-homeless-families/ar-BB15gaO2), helping us address family homelessness in our region. This builds on the work done in 2018 and 2019 where Emeryville and Oakland leaders combined resources and cleaned up the encampment site behind the Home Depot while moving those community members into shelter with services.
* _4300 San Pablo Avenue (future):_ Earlier this year, the city council approved exclusive negotiating rights with EAH Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer,[ **to construct a 68-unit intergenerational affordable housing project **](http://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/)aimed at seniors and formerly homeless or foster care system-involved youth. The project will go through the development and design process, with construction hopefully beginning in 2022.

  ![Rendering of future Intergenerational Affordable Housing Project at 4300 San Pablo Avenue](/img/eah-san-pablo.jpg)
* _3600 San Pablo Avenue (The Evoy):_ In 2017, the city council unanimously directed city staff to pursue acquisition of 3600/3610/3620 San Pablo Avenue or the purposes of building permanent supportive housing on the site. In 2019, with the help of a loan from the city, affordable housing developer RCD Housing acquired the site during a bankruptcy proceeding and entered into an agreement with the city for the development of affordable housing. [**The project will contain 90 units**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F) made available to very low income renters, including a number of units that will provide permanent supportive housing to people experiencing homelessness in our community. The ground floor will include a permanent, indoor facility and dining room for [**ECAP**](https://www.ecapprogram.com/), which serves over 200,000 meals annually to low-income seniors and people experiencing homelessness and hunger in Alameda County.

![Rendering of future Permanent Supportive Housing at 3600 San Pablo Avenue](/img/rcd-housing.jpg)

* _Measure C (2018):_ The city council reviewed the draft expenditure plan for Emeryville's $50M affordable housing bond in December and anticipates approving it early in 2021. [**You can review the draft Measure C Expenditure Plan here.**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8972934&GUID=6DFAF9DC-7D9E-4859-B55A-7526F8312BCA)
* _COVID Relief:_ 2020 posed unique challenges to community members when the state and county health officers closed various elements of the state and local economy in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. The city responded quickly, enacting one of the state's strongest eviction moratoria and [**turning $400,000 in disaster relief funds into emergency rental assistance**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/14/new-coronavirus-relief-funds-launch-for-struggling-east-bay-renters/) for lower-income renters. [**You can learn more about the various protections and provisions in place here.**](http://www.emeryville.org/1364/COVID-19-Housing-Resources#:\~:text=The%20Emeryville%20City%20Council%20approved,to%20the%20COVID%2D%2019%20pandemic.)

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #2_

**_Public Safety Planning_** _– As we move into a new period of rapid growth, we have to understand how increased residential density impacts our public safety infrastructure. I will put forth a long-term fiscal plan to help Emeryville sustain the same high-quality services we all enjoy without facing sudden costs in future budgets._

_2020 Progress on Priority #2_

In March, voters overwhelmingly approved Measure F, the city's quarter-cent sales tax to support public safety, code enforcement, public works and early child education services. Together, the council identified this suite of investments as helping us invest in our city's safety services.

* You can [**learn more about Emeryville Measure F here**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1328/Measure-F-Measure-for-a-Safer-Emeryville). The city began collecting this new revenue in July 2020 and will review the new receipts in the first half of 2021. COVID is anticipated to have dramatically impacted the initial revenue estimates. Before Measure F, all of the sales tax monies collected at local stores go directly to Alameda County and the state, very little of which comes back to Emeryville as a percentage of gross receipts. Measure F is the city's first locally-controlled sales tax that cannot be taken or controlled by other government agencies.
* 

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #3_

**_Parks and Open Space_** _– We have a serious shortage of green space. Civic engagement comes from making communities livable and enjoyable. I am committed to taking action to significantly increase the amount of useable park space in our community._

_2020 Progress on Priority #3_

After opening two new community parks in 2018, the city council used 2019 to move forward in the concept/design and construction of two new parks. As the evidence of our climate crisis comes into greater focus, the community rallied around several events I cosponsored to keep our community clean and green.

* The council approved the design elements for a new playground at Davenport Mini-Park, which is situated just west of the Trader Vic’s on the peninsula. Currently, there are no playground areas on the peninsula to serve Watergate families or visitors of our marina. The project should move into the bidding phase in 2020.
* The council approved the necessary agreements for the [**Horton Landing Park**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/502/study?bidId=). The park has been in conceptual development for over a decade as [**a complimentary part of the South Bayfront Bridge**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1291/Bayfront-Ped-Bridge). Now that the bridge is approved and in construction, the park will move forward in conjunction with that project.
* Over a six month period, I worked with some amazing Emeryville business partners: Amyris, Grifols, Pixar, Decathlon Sports, CLIF Bar, IKEA Emeryville, Wareham Development, Stasher Bag, as well as Save the Bay and the Golden Gate Audubon Society to pull together a two day event called “Clean Up to Green Up” for the community. Emeryville companies and their employees participated in a shoreline cleanup, with hundreds of volunteers working on our shoreline on a Friday, [**followed by a plogging event on Saturday,**](https://www.endurancesportswire.com/clif-bar-decathlon-and-ikea-host-fitness-cleanup-event/) where residents and visitors jogged and picked up trash around the city. If you missed it:

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #4_

**_Transit Infrastructure_** _– As we grow, we must plan for the future of transportation. We must do this with the environment and public safety in mind. I will initiate a community conversation aimed at planning for the future of growth and development in Emeryville with an emphasis on green and mass transit._

_2019 Progress on Priority #4_

The work to keep Emeryville’s streets safe continued this past year. This included preventing a major glut of cars diverted from a proposal to renovate the Maze, a Shared Mobility Ordinance, recommendations for safety improvements to some of our bicycle boulevards, and other long-term infrastructure projects. Much more is expected to happen in 2020!

* Earlier this year, Emeryville residents received a notice from Caltrans about a public hearing related to reconstruction of the MacArthur Maze. [**I responded immediately,**](https://www.kqed.org/news/11742515/caltrans-pauses-big-macarthur-maze-project-after-blasts-from-mayors-residents) working with partners in other cities, the county and regional entities to address the situation. [**Our efforts resulted in stopping the completely unnecessary project from moving forward**](https://www.thebaycitybeacon.com/politics/caltrans-delays-major-east-bay-project-after-local-backlash/article_85e76ed6-6aac-11e9-ba4e-1f2ee257bd0a.html).
* The city council approved a [**Dockless Shared Mobility Ordinance**](http://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/11635/19-005-_-Dockless-Shared-Mobility-Systems-_-Adopted-04_02_2019) this past year. The ordinance applies to bikeshare and scooter companies. Some residents have asked when the permit applications for scooter companies will be made available. Due to litigation in another jurisdiction, and on the advice of the city attorney, the city has not yet made permits available to scooter companies.
* In August, [**I witnessed a pedestrian get struck by a truck at 45th and Hollis Streets**](https://www.ktvu.com/news/emeryville-councilman-pushes-for-safety-improvements-at-busy-intersection). Following the event, I requested an agenda item at the Public Works and Transportation Committee to discuss safety at several intersections, including 45th and Hollis. [**I am committed to making our streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians**](https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/08/22/motorist-strikes-man-in-emeryville-crosswalk/). The Committee took up my agenda item in November and has proposed some changes to 45th and 53rd Streets that will be reviewed by the city’s Bicycle-Pedestrian Advisory Committee in spring before coming to council.
* [**The council approved design changes for 40th Street**](https://sf.streetsblog.org/2019/07/15/emeryville-approves-40th-street-protected-bike-lanes/), something I had requested the city work on back in 2018. The project remains unfunded but will bring major transit time and bike/ped safety improvements to 40th Street when built.
* The Emery-Go-Round’s Board secured a long-term lease from Caltrans to build a bus yard beneath I-580 on the east side of Mandela Parkway. The council also helped the Emery-Go-Round collect unpaid payments due to the Emery-Go-Round from several large properties that were not current on their obligation.
* The county is currently working with the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and AC Transit to design and implement a new vision for the San Pablo Avenue Corridor. While the project is years from construction, residents were given an opportunity to weigh in on the various design proposals this year, including community hearings in Emeryville. [**You can learn more about the project here**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/multimodal-arterial-roads/sanpabloave/).
* The [**Ashby Interchange Project**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/highway-improvement/i-80-ashby-avenue-sr-13-interchange-improvements/) is getting closer to being completely redone. The city was recently asked to select a preferred design concept for the interchange. Although Caltrans has the final say, we have requested a design that incorporates a bike-ped crossing and the creation of a new park on the west side of the interchange, along with a vista point for viewing the Bay and San Francisco from the Emeryville side of Ashby, creating a new city park where the footprint of the current interchange sits.
* After years of planning, a contractor was selected to build the [**South Bayfront Bridge**](http://www.biggscardosa.com/home/index.php/projects/transportation/pedestrian-bicycle/south-bayfront-pedestrian-bicycle-bridge). This bridge will connect pedestrians and bicyclists between Bay Street and 53rd Street over the railroad tracks. Construction will begin soon.
* In 2018, the city secured funding to improve our three train crossings. We are closing in on approval of the design with UPRR. [**Learn more about the safety enhancements that will come with these improvements.**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/05/01/updates-rail-safety-quiet-zone-funding-south-bayfront-bridge-progress-parking-management-plan/)
* As the city’s representative to the Alameda County Transportation Commission, I’m pleased to report that the [**Student Transit Pass Program**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/studentpass/) is now available to all Emery Unified students.
* As one of Alameda County’s two city representatives to the nine-county [**Bay Area Air Quality Management District**](https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/board-of-directors), I have pushed for the regional agency that helps regulate air pollutants to become more vocal and involved in solutions to our climate crisis. [**Other Air District Boards and their members have been preventing us from making progress for too long**](https://la.streetsblog.org/2019/12/13/aqmd-chair-william-burke-speaks-out-against-transit/). To demonstrate that a safe, complete active transit network could change transportation for the region while improving the environment, I biked 41 miles to a December board meeting. [**The action was supported by active transit advocates**](https://cal.streetsblog.org/2019/12/17/air-quality-board-member-rides-a-bike-to-meeting-why-is-this-newsworthy/). I will continue to raise awareness for transportation solutions going forward.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #5_

**_Small Business_** _– An important element of livability comes from supporting small, local-serving businesses that give our community character. I would like us to leverage the fees gathered from the development process to help us support and grow small business._

_2020 Progress on Priority #5_

The city continued with programs we began in 2019 to support small business. In 2020, I hope that the city will expand our rebate programs to support small businesses. The city unified the minimum wage for businesses of all sizes on July 1st.

* In May, the city council passed a series of emergency ordinances to protect small businesses. Among these, the city council put an eviction moratorium in place for small businesses, while also adopting a repayment ordinance that requires commercial property owners to offer extended periods of time as great as a one-year for businesses to catch up on late rent payments. The ordinance will remain in effect after the state of emergency ends.
* In June, the city council reprogrammed approximately $200,000 that typically goes toward facade grants into grants for businesses impacted by the looting that took place in late May. The city provided money to over 30 impacted local businesses.
* In November, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors announced a small business assistance program to provide grants to businesses impacted by COVID. To incentivize local participation in the program, a portion of the funds were dedicated on a first-come, first-serve basis to city's who matched the grant amounts. The city council acted quickly, putting up $115,000 as match funding, moving Emeryville's businesses to the front of the line for the county's contribution.
* In the fall I requested a future agenda item to create a rebate program for small businesses that apply and are approved for a cabaret license. Cabaret licenses allow for live music performances, karaoke, and other entertainment on the premises. They are approved on a calendar-year basis at the discretion of the city council. Allowing small businesses to receive relief from the cost of the license through a rebate program will help sustain small, local businesses and bring more entertainment options to our city. This item will be on the agenda in 2020.

One of my other goals as your councilmember has been to build community and defend the dignity of traditionally marginalized voices in our community. In May, after [**the City of Dublin voted against raising the pride flag to recognize Pride Month**](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/05/27/another-east-bay-city-will-fly-rainbow-flag-for-dublin-after-councils-rejection/), in response to homophobic vitriol at their public comment, [**I pushed for our city to raise a second pride flag in solidarity with anyone anywhere whose community was not supportive**](https://abc7news.com/community-events/pride-flags-raised-in-emeryville-amid-flag-dispute-in-dublin/5315968/). The event at City Hall was wonderfully attended by elected officials and residents from all across the Bay Area. In the end, [**the City of Dublin reversed itself and voted to raise the Pride Flag**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/29/borenstein-dublin-council-expected-to-fly-gay-pride-flag-after-all/). I visited Dublin as an honorary guest and [**presented our second pride flag to them**](https://www.independentnews.com/dublin-commemorates-lgbtq-pride-month/collection_3072468a-984a-11e9-86df-ebf8172f1e7d.html), which now sits in the Mayor’s Office at Dublin City Hall as a symbol of friendship between our cities.

Thank you all for continuing to contact me with your ideas, questions, issues and concerns. So many of the things that are accomplished every year are those small items many of you bring to my attention that I can help get done with help and support from my council colleagues and our excellent city staff. I enjoy meeting many of you at my rotating town halls or bumping into you at local eateries and volunteer events. I hope to see you soon in the New Year!

Here is the council organization for 2020:
