![2020 Emeryville City Council](/img/2020-council.png "2020 Emeryville City Council")

Welcome to the 2020 Wrap-Up. 2020 was an unusual year and one that I'm sure many of us would rather soon forget. Although we continue to struggle through a global pandemic wrought with ongoing public health and economic challenges, it's more important than ever for public officials and agencies to remain transparent, accessible, and accountable to their communities. Since being first elected in 2016, I have published this annual wrap-up as my way of remaining transparent and accountable to the Emeryville community about the work that we've done on the five policy priority areas I identified as a candidate. Although my near-weekly town halls went on hiatus this year due to COVID, I am still in touch with many of you regularly about issues in our city.

As a reminder, if you’d like to check out the wrap-ups from any of the past three years, you can view each of them here:

[**2019 Wrap-Up: Priorities on Progress**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2020/01/06/2019-wrap-up-progress-on-priorities/)

[**2018 Wrap-Up: Priorities on Progress**](https://wordpress.com/post/johnbauters.wordpress.com/4365)

[**2017 Wrap-Up: Priorities on Progress**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/closing-out-2017-progress-on-priorities/)

The five priorities I identified when I was a candidate for this office are provided below. The five sections titled _“2016 Campaign Priorities Statement”_ are the top five priorities I provided when asked to provide them as a candidate back in 2016. Below each of them is a section called _“2020 Progress on Priority”_ that summarizes actions taken during 2020 on those same issues I campaigned on.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #1_

**_Housing Affordability & Stability_** _– We must commit to building affordable ownership housing and to providing legal protections for tenants. I will use my expertise on housing programs and policies to help stabilize housing for our resident community. This is my highest priority for the city and it is the most common issue on the minds of residents I’ve spoken with._

_2020 Progress on Priority #1_

Emeryville continues to be a regional leader on affordable housing and tenant protections.

* _4300 San Pablo Avenue_: In 2019, [**the Emeryville City Council agreed to provide shelter for 20-25 homeless Oakland families with children**](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Why-Emeryville-is-building-a-new-homeless-shelter-14484146.php) at the former Rec Center site, owned by the city. Earlier this year, [**unhoused families with children moved into the site**](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oakland-emeryville-partnership-to-shelter-homeless-families/ar-BB15gaO2), helping us address family homelessness in our region. This builds on the work done in 2018 and 2019 where Emeryville and Oakland leaders combined resources and cleaned up the encampment site behind the Home Depot while moving those community members into shelter with services.
* _4300 San Pablo Avenue (future):_ Earlier this year, the city council approved exclusive negotiating rights with EAH Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer,[ **to construct a 68-unit intergenerational affordable housing project**](http://ktgy.com/4300-san-pablo-eah-housing-and-ktgy-architecture-planning-selected-for-intergenerational-affordable-housing-community-development-in-emeryville-calif/) aimed at seniors and formerly homeless or foster care system-involved youth. The project will go through the development and design process, with construction hopefully beginning in 2022.

  ![Rendering of future Intergenerational Affordable Housing Project at 4300 San Pablo Avenue](/img/eah-san-pablo.jpg)
* _3600 San Pablo Avenue (The Evoy):_ In 2017, the city council unanimously directed city staff to pursue acquisition of 3600/3610/3620 San Pablo Avenue or the purposes of building permanent supportive housing on the site. In 2019, with the help of a loan from the city, affordable housing developer RCD Housing acquired the site during a bankruptcy proceeding and entered into an agreement with the city for the development of affordable housing. [**The project will contain 90 units**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8732104&GUID=88AD685C-976C-4652-A23B-88ACD644DA9F) made available to very low income renters, including a number of units that will provide permanent supportive housing to people experiencing homelessness in our community. The ground floor will include a permanent, indoor facility and dining room for [**ECAP**](https://www.ecapprogram.com/), which serves over 200,000 meals annually to low-income seniors and people experiencing homelessness and hunger in Alameda County.

![Rendering of future Permanent Supportive Housing at 3600 San Pablo Avenue](/img/rcd-housing.jpg)

* _Measure C (2018):_ The city council reviewed the draft expenditure plan for Emeryville's $50M affordable housing bond in December and anticipates approving it early in 2021. [**You can review the draft Measure C Expenditure Plan here.**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8972934&GUID=6DFAF9DC-7D9E-4859-B55A-7526F8312BCA)
* _COVID Relief:_ 2020 posed unique challenges to community members when the state and county health officers closed various elements of the state and local economy in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19. The city responded quickly, enacting one of the state's strongest eviction moratoria and [**turning $400,000 in disaster relief funds into emergency rental assistance**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/14/new-coronavirus-relief-funds-launch-for-struggling-east-bay-renters/) for lower-income renters. [**You can learn more about the various protections and provisions in place here.**](http://www.emeryville.org/1364/COVID-19-Housing-Resources#:\~:text=The%20Emeryville%20City%20Council%20approved,to%20the%20COVID%2D%2019%20pandemic.)
* _Sherwin-Williams ("The Emery"):_ Construction finally broke ground on the 500-unit residential project, which will include a new 2+ acre city park, a community organic garden, and the final, southernmost segment of the Emeryville Greenway. The project is anticipated to take 40 total months to build, and we are finishing year 1 of construction. 87 of the units will be reserved for low- and very low-income households.

![Shewin Williams site rendering](/img/sherwin-williams.jpg)

* _6701 Shellmound ("Nady Site"):_ The long-abandoned Nady property at the Shellmound Street off-ramp was cleared in December 2018/January 2019 to make way for a new, 186-unit project. The project involves some complex jurisdictional issues related to an encampment abutting the city property on Caltrans right-of-way. The city continues to work with the site developer, Caltrans, and the City of Berkeley to meet state requirements that would allow for building to being at the site.
* _Public Market:_ Tenants moved into Marketplace Parcel D (the Avalon on the old theater site) this year and the units wrapping around the parking structure on Parcel C2 are being finalized for occupancy.
* [**You can check monthly updates on all pending projects in the city at this link.**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/archive.aspx?AMID=40&Type=&ADID=)

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #2_

**_Public Safety Planning_** _– As we move into a new period of rapid growth, we have to understand how increased residential density impacts our public safety infrastructure. I will put forth a long-term fiscal plan to help Emeryville sustain the same high-quality services we all enjoy without facing sudden costs in future budgets._

_2020 Progress on Priority #2_

In March, voters overwhelmingly approved Measure F, the city's quarter-cent sales tax to support public safety, code enforcement, public works and early child education services. The council identified this suite of investments to bolster our public safety, infrastructure safety, and prevention programs.

* _Emeryville Measure F:_ You can [**learn more about Emeryville Measure F here**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1328/Measure-F-Measure-for-a-Safer-Emeryville). The city began collecting this new revenue in July 2020 and will review the new receipts in the first half of 2021 before allocating funds. COVID is anticipated to have dramatically impacted the initial revenue estimates. Before Measure F, all of the sales tax monies collected at local stores go directly to Alameda County and the state, very little of which comes back to Emeryville as a percentage of gross receipts. Measure F is the city's first locally-controlled sales tax that cannot be taken or controlled by other government agencies.
* _Policing Policies:_ In the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, [**the city council agendized a special meeting to discuss a suite of policies to review police practices**](https://emeryville.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8662824&GUID=A796D489-A6B1-4A1E-980C-6EED2A7AE51C). Although [**the city meets the policy standards put forth by advocacy campaigns like 8 Can't Wait**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1366/Our-Philosophy), we identified several others we wished to reform. In December, the council discussed reducing a number of local criminal misdemeanor and infraction penalties in the Emeryville Municipal Code to administrative citations. The other policies have been referred to the city's Public Safety Committee for discussion and recommendation to council.
* _League of California Cities:_ At the end of last year, I was appointed by the East Bay Division of the [**League of California Cities**](https://www.cacities.org/) to represent the East Bay on the state's Public Safety Committee for calendar year 2020. We review and take positions of support and opposition on state legislative proposals related to public safety. At the request of the East Bay Division of the League, I was reappointed to serve on this committee through 2021.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #3_

**_Parks and Open Space_** _– We have a serious shortage of green space. Civic engagement comes from making communities livable and enjoyable. I am committed to taking action to significantly increase the amount of useable park space in our community._

_2020 Progress on Priority #3_

After opening two new community parks in 2018 and near construction on a new Davenport Park & Playground on the peninsula in 2019, the city's park progress on new parks continued this year, with a couple anticipated openings in 2021.

* _New Parks Coming:_ The city anticipates opening two new parks in 2021. The first is the [**Horton Landing Park**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/502/study?bidId=), which Is connected to the new South Bayfront Bridge (discussed below in Transit). The second is Davenport Park, just west of Trader Vic's on the north side of Powell Street. When complete, it will offer a play structure for families out on the peninsula.

![Diagram of Davenport Park Plan](/img/davenport-park.jpg)

* _Point Emery:_ The city is actively looking at work to prevent further erosion of Point Emery, near the Ashby Interchange. The city is currently working to get approval from the appropriate agencies to install new "rip-rap" that protects the shoreline from soil erosion so we can preserve this popular spot.
* _Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD):_ In 2020 I was re-elected to serve as one of Alameda County’s two city representatives to the nine-county [**Bay Area Air Quality Management District**](https://www.baaqmd.gov/about-the-air-district/board-of-directors), which oversees air quality regulation, enforcement, and monitoring. In January I was appointed chair of the District's Stationary Source Committee, where our work is focused on rule development for the regulation of large industrial sources, including refineries, the Port, cement plants and waste disposal facilities. In November, I was selected to serve as one of the Board's three Executive Officers, and will serve as Board Secretary for 2021. I am proud that Emeryville  has been recognized for its leadership on environmental stewardship and look forward to continuing to represent our city and county at this important agency in the coming year.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #4_

**_Transportation Infrastructure_** _– As we grow, we must plan for the future of transportation. We must do this with the environment and public safety in mind. I will initiate a community conversation aimed at planning for the future of growth and development in Emeryville with an emphasis on active and mass transit._

_2020 Progress on Priority #4_

A lot of wonderful things happened again in the transportation infrastructure space, despite 2020's best efforts to ruin everything.

* _South Bayfront Bridge:_ In the early morning hours of December 20th, the long-awaited bicycle-pedestrian [**South Bayfront Bridge**](http://www.biggscardosa.com/home/index.php/projects/transportation/pedestrian-bicycle/south-bayfront-pedestrian-bicycle-bridge), that will connect the final, southern segment of the Emeryville Greenway across the Union Pacific Railroad was installed. The construction of the approaches and the Horton Landing Park will continue, with the anticipated opening date in fall of 2021.

  ![](/img/bridge.jpeg)
* _COVID Slow Streets/Your New Doyle Street Greenway:_ When the pandemic began, cities looked for ways to create safe outdoor spaces for people to exercise while practicing adequate social distancing. In Emeryville, the [**Transportation Committee**](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/110/Transportation-Committee) recommended that we convert parts of Doyle Street into protected active transportation space. The result was extremely popular with residents and the council received overwhelmingly positive feedback. In October, the Alameda County Transportation Commission put out $75,000 "quick-build" grants for cities that wanted to make permanent bike/ped changes. We leaped on the opportunity to make permanent improvements to Doyle Street. The result is a fully separated bike/ped space, coupled with street closures at both ends. We hope you ❤️ it as much as we do!

  ![](/img/doyle-street.jpeg)
* _San Pablo Avenue Corridor Plan:_ The county continues to work with the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and AC Transit to design and implement a new vision for the San Pablo Avenue Corridor. Based on public surveys and other studies conducted over the past two years, the county anticipates rolling out a first phase of changes to the Oakland and Emeryville segments of San Pablo in the next couple years, with BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) lanes and protected bike lanes. [**You can learn more about the project here**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/multimodal-arterial-roads/sanpabloave/).
* _Horton & 59th Street Bike Lane Extensions:_ As part of our annual repaving program, we installed new bollards on our existing protected bike lanes, and extended them up to 62nd Street, while also putting parking-protected bike lanes along 59th Street between Hollis and Horton. Our goal is to make these improvements as part of already-scheduled paving plans.
* _Quiet Zones/Safe Railroad Crossings:_ For years I have heard from residents about the challenges posed by the train horns in Emeryville. In 2018 I pushed the council and staff to compete for a State CTC Grant of SB 1 funding to help bring much needed safety improvements that would also allow us to create a federally-designated quiet zone. The UPRR has recently signed off on the final design elements and the state is expected to release our grant money to us in January 2021 with construction anticipated to begin in summer 2021. [**Learn more about the project here.**](https://johnbauters.wordpress.com/2018/05/01/updates-rail-safety-quiet-zone-funding-south-bayfront-bridge-progress-parking-management-plan/)
* _Ashby Interchange:_ The [**Ashby Interchange Project**](https://www.alamedactc.org/programs-projects/highway-improvement/i-80-ashby-avenue-sr-13-interchange-improvements/) project will begin its final design phase this coming year. The original rotary-style off-ramps have been removed in favor of a tight diamond design. The project will include a new bicycle-pedestrian crossing from Emeryville to the Bay Trail, with a vista park on the marina side of the freeway. Construction is estimated to begin in early 2023 after right-of-way entitlements and other legal approvals are completed in 2022, following final design approval.
* _Alameda CTC:_ As Emeryville's representative to the [**Alameda County Transportation Commission**](https://www.alamedactc.org/), I was humbled to be elected the Vice Chair of the Commission in January 2020. This leadership position is traditionally two, one-year terms. I work closely with Commission Chair and  Mayor of San Leandro, Pauline Cutter, as well as the 20 other representatives to the Commission in guiding the transportation policies, projects, programs and investments for Alameda County. I am very proud of the incredible work we do here in Emeryville on Transportation and Public Works, and have special gratitude for our Public Works staff, city manager, and Councilmember Medina who work closely with me in helping make Emeryville a safe, livable, and accessible community for people of all ages, incomes and abilities.

_2016 Campaign Priorities Statement #5_

**_Small Business_** _– An important element of livability comes from supporting small, local-serving businesses that give our community character. I would like us to leverage the fees gathered from the development process to help us support and grow small business._

_2020 Progress on Priority #5_

The COVID pandemic has been particularly harsh on our small business economy this past year. I've spent countless hours this year working with our local small businesses to make our small, nimble city adaptive and responsive to the needs of businesses trying to weather the pandemic and its economic impact. The city council acted unanimously and decisively on a number of initiatives this year, which have helped bridge many of our local businesses into 2021. We have more work to do, but to date our actions have included the following:

* _Small Business Eviction Moratorium & Rental Repayment:_ In May, the city council passed a series of urgency ordinances to protect small businesses. Among these, the city council put an eviction moratorium in place for restaurants, while also adopting [**a repayment ordinance**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13131/20-019-_-COVID-19-Commercial-Food-Establishment-Urgency-Ordinance-_-Adopted?bidId=) that requires commercial property owners to offer extended periods of time as great as a one-year for businesses to catch up on late rent payments. Subsequent to the city's eviction moratorium, [**Governor Newsom signed Executive Order N-80-20**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13209/92320-EO-N-80-20-COVID-19-signed?bidId=) on September 23rd, which put a statewide moratorium on commercial evictions through March 31, 2021.
* _Small Biz Emergency Grants:_ In June, the city council reprogrammed approximately $200,000 of Small Business funding that typically goes toward facade grants into grants for businesses impacted by the looting that took place in late May. The city provided money to over 30 impacted local businesses. We also approved a parklet program to allow restaurants interested in doing outdoor dining a chance to expedite their process and waive normal processing fees. A number of businesses took advantage of that program. In October, we extended it to include other businesses and offered temporary use permits. Contact Planning if you're interested.

![Doyle Street Cafe Parklet](/img/doyle-street-cafe.jpg)

* _Delivery Fee Ordinance:_ In October, the city council adopted [**an urgency ordinance that capped the cost of food-service delivery fees**](http://www.emeryville.org/DocumentCenter/View/13255/APPROVED-Urgency-Ordinance-No-20-023---delivery-fee-cap?bidId=). Emeryville was joined by a number of other east bay cities in regulating delivery companies that were gouging delivery prices. The ordinance is set to continue for 180 days after the state of emergency ends, giving the council time to consider a permanent ordinance.
* _Small Biz Financial Aid Program:_ In November, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors announced a small business assistance program to provide grants to businesses impacted by COVID. To incentivize local participation in the program, a portion of the funds were dedicated on a first-come, first-serve basis to city's who matched the grant amounts. The city council acted quickly, putting up $115,000 as match funding, moving Emeryville's businesses to the front of the line for the county's contribution. A list of awardees is expected soon.
* You can find a comprehensive resource on federal, state, and local resources for businesses on our city's website [**by visiting us here**](http://www.emeryville.org/1365/COVID-19-BUSINESS-RESOURCES).

_2021 Emeryville City Council_

![](/img/council-2021.png)Normally, this is place where I post the annual photo of the Emeryville City Council taken at our December meeting after we have reorganized to select our new Mayor and Vice Mayor for the following year. Because we have met remotely all year, that group picture was not taken, so I have shared our council reorg photo instead. Congratulations to my colleagues Dianne Martinez for being selected to serve as our city's Mayor and to Scott Donahue for being selected as Vice Mayor for 2021. Congratulations to Councilmember Patz for completing a challenging year as Emeryville's Mayor. [**You can learn more about the members of the Emeryville City Council here.**](http://www.emeryville.org/382/Council-Members) The city will be updating this page in early 2021 to contain additional information about council committee assignments, roles, and other functions to help better connect you with your elected representatives on the issues important to you.

I wish all of you peace, health and safety during these challenging times. Together, we can get through this pandemic with patience, mutual support, and a commitment to rebuild stronger. Hoping that I will see many of you in person at some point during 2021.

Cheers,

John
