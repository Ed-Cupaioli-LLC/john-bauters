title: Virtual Town Hall on Emeryville City Services

---
Dear Emeryville Neighbor:

This Monday, May 9th at 7:00pm, I will be hosting a virtual Town Hall to discuss city services, local needs, resident priorities, and a new revenue opportunity the city is considering to support these important programs and services.

The city is continuously engaged in the process of listening to residents, assessing city service levels, and examining opportunities to improve the quality of life for our residents. In the past months, the city conducted resident polling on the quality of citywide services, council members have been listening to residents at our resident advisory committees about unmet needs, we launched a resident survey on the city's website, and I have been holding local town halls with groups that have wanted to discuss general or specific issues facing our city.

The input we received has been extremely helpful. We learned that residents really love living in Emeryville and feel a deep sense of pride about the direction of the city. We also heard that there were some opportunities to enhance or improve existing services to help sustain a quality of life and provide for the future of our residents.

The city council received the outcomes of those listening efforts and directed staff to examine ways to support those resident goals while minimizing cost to residents. **No decisions have been made about what, if anything, to do.**

The goal of the May 9th Town Hall is to share what we've learned with interested residents, collect additional information, share the one revenue opportunity the city is considering, and answer questions. Based on that information, the council will continue the discussion with this new input as we continue to evaluate the best ways to meet resident needs.

[You can find all the information for the Town Hall at this page on the city website, including the link to the meeting on May 9th at 7:00pm.](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1428/Emeryville---Join-the-Conversation)  On that page, you can also complete the city's survey if you have not already done so or in case you're unable to join us Monday evening.

Attendees will be able to comment in the Q&A box as to their own ideas and preferences, and submit questions that will be moderated for me to address during the event.

I hope to see you there!

Cheers,

Mayor Bauters
