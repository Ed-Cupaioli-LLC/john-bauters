<p>Hello Friends--</p>
<p>It's August. Block Party season. The East Bay's tiniest town is looking to host one of the biggest block parties of the summer, right here in Emeryville - and you are invited!</p>
<p>In Emeryville, we don't throw your ordinary block party. We're known for being completely rotten, after all. Mayor Medina is throwing one helluva rotten party this Saturday, August 24th on Park Avenue from 11:30 - 4:30. But it's not your average block party...</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4488" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/city-of-emeryville.sfotb_.rottencity.2019.poster.072919.png" alt="City-of-Emeryville.SFOTB.RottenCity.2019.POSTER.072919.png" width="1200" height="1600" /></p>
<p>Perhaps you'd like to bring your kids for fun in the Decathlon Sports Kids Zone where they can participate in athletic activities. They can also play with bubble art, have their face painted, play carnival games and more! There is even a Tiny Toes Toddler Movement section for little ones!</p>
<p>Adults can make their way to the IKEA lounge where they can order Trader Vic's original mai tais and Double Rainbow ice cream - all from here in Emeryville. After you have your liquid courage, come compete in block party games like cornhole (bags for you non-Midwestern types!).</p>
<p>There will also be an Ohana Cannabis outdoor lounge. Sample some edibles in this adult-only zone right outside of city hall. Don't worry - if you get the munchies we have stationed our local food trucks right next door.</p>
<p>Ever want to submit your elected officials to a dunk tank of freezing cold water? Well, here's your chance! The city council will take turns at the "Dunk a Dignitary" (LOL) station where you can get back at them for everything from removing your favorite parking space to painting your curb red.</p>
<p>DJ Niique will serve up the beats and I will serve as your emcee for the event, which will include a few special introductions, a recognition, and some other "only-in-Emeryville" fun. There will be a free Zumba lesson and the last hour plus will be a city dance party.</p>
<p><strong>But the best part of it all????</strong> Well, that's clearly going to be the 1st-ever Rottenest Dog Contest. Mayor Medina and her team of judges will carefully evaluate your dog for everything from stinky breath to snaggleteeth, selecting category winners as well as an overall winner for Rottenest in Show! Bring your pooch and compete for a title that nobody needs but everyone wants!</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there. Bring your friends from Oakland, Berkeley or wherever and show them what a rebellious and fun-spirited little town we are. Hell, let's make E'villains of them all!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>John</p>
