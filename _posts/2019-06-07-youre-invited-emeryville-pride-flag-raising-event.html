<p><em>What:</em> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Emeryville</span> DOUBLE Pride Flag Raising</strong></p>
<p><em>Where:</em> <strong><span style="color:#ff9900;">Emeryville</span> City Hall, 1333 Park Avenue, Emeryville</span>, CA 94608</strong></p>
<p><em>When:</em> <strong>Saturday, June 8, 2019, from Noon to 1:30pm</strong></p>
<p><em>Why:</em> Recent events revealed that hate and ignorance toward the LGBTQ community still exist here in the Bay Area. In an effort to display solidarity with the LGBTQ community and show that <span style="color:#008000;">Emeryville</span> is a place where all are welcome, the <span style="color:#0000ff;">Emeryville</span> City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday, June 4th to hang a second Pride flag as a welcoming symbol and an act of solidarity with those who do not feel safe or accepted in their home community.</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Mayor and City Council in the City of Dublin, <span style="color:#cc99ff;">Emeryville's</span> second Pride flag will come down later this month and be raised in Dublin at a special ceremony on June 22nd as a gift of friendship from <span style="color:#666699;">Emeryville</span> to the People of Dublin.</p>
<p><em>Program</em>: Guest speakers will include <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-bauters-0b74434/">John Bauters</a></strong> (City of Emeryville); California State Senator <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/"><strong>Scott Wiener</strong></a> (D - San Francisco); California Assemblywoman <a href="https://a15.asmdc.org/"><strong>Buffy Wicks</strong> </a>(D - Oakland); and Councilmember <a href="https://www.shawnkumagai.com/"><strong>Shawn Kumagai</strong></a> (City of Dublin). We will raise both flags in a ceremony following these remarks.</p>
<p>There will be some recognition for our out-of-town visitors and one special prize (yes, the Emeryville Pride Crystal Tiara Award is back!).</p>
<p>There will be food! Come get some bites and a sandwich from <a href="http://www.grilledcheezguy.com/">Grilled Cheez Guy</a>!</p>
<p>We will have entertainment! Drag Queens will perform on the steps of City Hall after our flag raising! <a href="https://www.thesisters.org/">The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence</a> will also be on hand to bring cheer and joy!</p>
<p>Come learn about the <a href="https://lambdademocrats.com/">Lambda </a>and <a href="https://eastbaystonewalldemocrats.org/">East Bay Stonewall</a> Clubs as well - they will have info booths on how you can support LGBTQ people and issues in the East Bay!</p>
<p>This event is open to everyone who has space in their heart to accept all people as worthy of dignity and respect. We are stronger as a community when we lead with kindness. I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>John</p>
