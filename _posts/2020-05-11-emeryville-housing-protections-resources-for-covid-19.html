<p>Dear Neighbor,</p>
<p>Over the past two months, a lot has changed about daily life. This post is dedicated to providing you with important information about a number of actions the city and county have taken to provide assistance to our residents. I want to begin by thanking you, the Emeryville community. Your compliance with <a href="http://www.acphd.org/media/572718/health-officer-order-20-10-shelter-in-place-20200429.pdf">Alameda County Health Officer Order 20-10</a> has been evidenced by the fact that <a href="https://ac-hcsa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/1e0ac4385cbe4cc1bffe2cf7f8e7f0d9">Emeryville continues to have the lowest number of cases for any city in the county</a>.</p>
<p>Outlined below are a series of important updates with links to new ordinances, FAQs, and other information on housing, rental assistance, utilities, transit, childcare, small businesses, public benefits programs and more. This page will be updated as information changes or new resources become available.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">HOUSING PROTECTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p>The Emeryville City Council has adopted a number of housing protections that all residents should know about:</p>
<p>(1) <strong><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12756/Emeryville-Urgency-Eviction-Moratorium"><em>Urgency Residential &amp; Commercial </em><em>Eviction Moratorium Ordinance</em></a></strong></p>
<p>This ordinance is in place until June 30, 2020. Under this law, no landlord may give a tenant a Notice to Terminate Tenancy while the Eviction Moratorium is in effect. Failure on the part of the landlord to comply with the moratorium gives a tenant an affirmative defense to an eviction action the landlord may try to bring based on that notice. The ordinance allows a narrow exception when an eviction is required to protect public health and safety (i.e. a tenant has a drug lab or<span style="color:var(--color-text);"> something similarly dangerous in the unit). It provides protections to all residential tenants, most commercial tenants, as well as some homeowners. Please read the full ordinance (link above) and the appropriate corresponding FAQ (links below) to learn more about your rights. Check back to this page for future updates to or extensions of this ordinance by future council action.</span></p>
<p>Groups covered by this ordinance:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>All</em> residential tenants in Emeryville
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12979/Residential-Tenant-Eviction-Moratorium-FAQs">Residential Tenant FAQ</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commercial tenants in Emeryville who have gross receipts of less than $7.5M annually (about 95% of Emeryville businesses)
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12980/Commercial-Tenant-Eviction-Moratorium-FAQs-FINAL">Commercial Tenant FAQ</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emeryville homeowners in Homeowner Associations (HOAs)
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12974/HOA-Foreclosure-Moratorium-FAQs">Homeowner FAQ</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, the city already has in place <em><a href="http://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1127/Eviction-Harassment-Ordinance">Tenant Protection and Just Cause Eviction Ordinances</a> </em>that provide additional tenant protections against harassment and no-fault evictions. Please review and know your rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you live in certain types of federally-subsidized housing, the federal CARES Act <em><a href="https://www.nhlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020.03.27-NHLP-CARES-Act-Eviction-Moratorium-Summary.pdf">provides some additional eviction protections</a></em> as well. Read more to see if it applies to you.</p>
<p>(2) <strong><em><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12972/COVID-19-Rental-Repayment-Ordinance">Rental Repayment Plan Ordinance</a></em></strong></p>
<p>This ordinance provides protections for residential tenants against evictions after the moratorium protections outlined above expire. Under this law, <em>before</em> a residential landlord can give an eviction notice to a tenant, they must offer the tenant a reasonable repayment plan for any unpaid rent accruing from April 1, 2020 through the expiration of the Governor's COVID-19 State of Emergency. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The repayment plan must be offered in writing and must be spread out over not less than 12 months.</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>(3) <strong><em><a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12984/ERAP-Program-Guidelines">Emergency Rental Assistance Program</a></em></strong></p>
<p>The city council opted to take $400,000 from the city's disaster relief reserves and use it to provide additional assistance to our lowest-income families facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The above link contains important information on the program's eligibility guidelines. You can also learn more about this on the <a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1364/COVID-19-Housing-Resources">city's website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Get Assistance--
<ul>
<li>The first month that is eligible for rental assistance will be June 2020. You must be an eligible Emeryville resident, as defined in the <a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12984/ERAP-Program-Guidelines">program guidelines</a>. Please note that if you weren't able to pay April or May, the <a href="https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12972/COVID-19-Rental-Repayment-Ordinance">rental repayment plan ordinance</a> is in place to help provide a bridge for tenants to repay those months over time. If sufficient funds exist, emergency rental assistance may also be available for July 2020.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.emeryville.org/1364/COVID-19-Housing-Resources">To Apply for Assistance, visit this city webpage for the application beginning at 9am on May 13th.</a> Applications will be accepted through May 20, 2020.</strong>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4604" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_0289.jpg" alt="IMG_0289.jpg" width="640" height="480" /> <em>Doyle Street</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>THE 2020 CENSUS</strong></span></p>
<p>Cities and counties receive local funding from the federal government based on the decennial census. Federal funding to local jurisdictions can be decreased substantially if we have a significant undercount. Alameda County stands to lose a significant amount of funding this year by returning a low census count. Currently, only about 60% of Emeryville residents have completed the census. Please complete the census today and help preserve federal funding for our community, which protects services and reduces the need for future local taxes. <a href="https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond.html?cid=20007:%2Bcomplete%20%2Bcensus:sem.ga:p:dm:en:&amp;utm_source=sem.ga&amp;utm_medium=p&amp;utm_campaign=dm:en&amp;utm_content=20007&amp;utm_term=%2Bcomplete%20%2Bcensus">Complete the 2020 Census here.</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your patience as we work together in response to the guidance from our state and county health officers. Many challenges lie ahead for the city as we begin to come out of the mandatory shelter-in-place orders. While the city has done a good job preparing for economic uncertainty over the past few years, no city was fully prepared to have the state shut down a vast majority of its economy. Together with our staff, your city council is already busy at work planning for the recovery that lies ahead. I'm proud to represent this city and I am grateful that we have some of the best civil servants in the Bay Area working alongside a dedicated city council to ensure that we give Emeryville the best chance possible for a strong recovery.</p>
<p>Stay safe, stay healthy, and thank you for your patience, cooperation and support during these difficult times.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>
<p>John</p>
