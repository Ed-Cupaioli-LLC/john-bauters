  - title: Housing & Homelessness
    id: Housing
    subtitle: >-
      We Continue to be Regional Leaders on Affordable Housing & Homelessness
      Services
    text: >-
      The cost of housing in Emeryville, like most of the state, is unaffordable
      for the average working household. Home ownership in California is at an
      all-time low and many families are spending over 50% of their monthly
      income on rent alone. Addressing the shortage of affordable housing and
      ending homelessness are my top priority as your councilmember.


      In 2018, Emeryville voters overwhelmingly approved Measure C, a $50
      million affordable housing bond to fund new affordable housing production
      and preserve existing affordable housing within our city. The bond
      proceeds will be used to implement the city's [Affordable Housing
      Expenditure
      Plan](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/13878/APPROVED-Resolution-No-21-13?bidId=){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Measure C funds will leverage millions
      more in county, state and federal dollars for affordable housing
      investment, allowing Emeryville to produce affordable housing while only
      paying a fraction of the overall cost.


      Emeryville has affordable housing dedicated to people experiencing
      homelessness, working families, seniors on fixed incomes, artists and
      transition-aged youth leaving foster care coming online in the next few
      years as a result of Emeryville voters commitment to being part of the
      solution. In April 2023, [Governor Newsom and the California Department of
      Housing and Community Development
      announced](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/04/05/governor-newsom-announces-11-new-jurisdictions-to-receive-a-prohousing-designation-for-accelerating-housing-production/){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that Emeryville had received a rare
      pro-housing designation from the state, making it eligible to be the first
      to receive funding for new affordable housing projects.


      In 2017, the City Council also approved a [Tenant Protection and Just
      Cause Eviction
      Ordinance](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Emeryville/#!/Emeryville05/Emeryville0540.html#5%E2%80%9040){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that provides tenants across the city with
      additional rights and remedies. Along with our [Smoking Pollution Control
      Ordinance](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Emeryville/html/Emeryville05/Emeryville0529.html#5-29.09){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 2018, the Council has been busy
      providing protections to homeowners and renters alike to ensure housing in
      our city is safe, livable, and healthy.


      While homelessness continues to rise in the Bay Area and across the state,
      due in large part to inadequate housing supply and affordability levels,
      Emeryville is not just providing housing to address the problem, but also
      providing compassionate shelter plus service care to our unhoused
      neighbors. In the [2022 Point-In-Time
      Count](https://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Emeryville-PIT-2022-Infographic-Report.pdf){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} conducted by Alameda County, Emeryville
      was one of the few cities that successfully decreased homelessness.

  - title: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FISCAL PREPAREDNESS
    id: econ
    subtitle: >-
      Balancing the books to guarantee Emeryville’s resilience from COVID-19 and
      beyond.
    text: >-
      Many years of good fiscal decisions and progressive budgeting practices
      have prepared Emeryville for changes to the economy. As the chair of
      Emeryville’s Budget & Governance Committee, I have worked closely with
      city staff and my colleagues to introduce budgeting practices that have
      paid down debt and unfunded liabilities while building reserves for an
      economic downturn. 


      As Mayor in 2018, I campaigned in support of Measure S, our Cannabis Tax,
      which strikes a strong balance between welcoming responsible cannabis
      industry partners into our city and collecting new tax revenues to fund
      critical city services. Like most communities, Emeryville is facing
      significant economic impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
      years of preparation have afforded us additional time to analyze the
      evolving landscape to ensure we can preserve the services that Emeryville
      residents have come to enjoy. I have worked closely with our local
      business and labor partners to be responsive to their needs so that our
      local economy remains vibrant and diverse.


      I will continue to look for ways to protect the city’s core services, to
      expand and diversify our local economy, and to support the businesses and
      workers that make up our local economy.
  - title: Safety and Justice
    id: safety
    subtitle: >-
      As our city grows, so too must our public safety system’s commitment to
      providing an equitable and just application of the law.
    text: >-
      As recent national events have reminded us, the quest for racial and
      social justice is far from over. In order for communities to realize
      lasting change, we must continue to have uncomfortable conversations about
      race and racism, and commit to taking action steps that address the
      unequal treatment many people experience.


      Since joining the city council, I have fought to protect the safety of our
      most vulnerable community members. My first act as a council member was to
      coauthor the city’s Sanctuary City resolution. I identified and pushed the
      city to end contracts with companies sharing personal and biometric data
      with ICE and have called for limits on the use of certain technologies
      like facial recognition that can be misused to target and discriminate
      against minorities. True community safety comes from making meaningful
      investments in community-based health, education, and youth programs.


      Preparedness is also a key part of our safety plan. For the past three
      years, I have pushed for the council to make additional discretionary
      contributions toward our disaster reserves. That planning is ultimately
      what allowed the city council to take $400,000 from our disaster reserves
      to fund the Emeryville Emergency Rental Assistance Fund in response to
      COVID. These funds were used to help many low-income and vulnerable
      community members who had COVID-related job loss cover rent for several
      months as a stopgap against eviction and financial debt. By protecting
      hundreds of long-term community members from displacement, the city took
      action to safeguard the broader public safety by protecting community
      members who are integral to the social fabric of our community.


      I have called on the council to eliminate criminal penalties in our
      municipal code for things that could be better handled as administrative
      citations. Doing so makes better use of the law enforcement resources we
      have by reserving police response for situations that necessitate their
      response while eliminating police response for minor matters that can
      become pretense to target, profile or criminalize black, indigenous, and
      other people of color. This is one of many reforms the council has
      scheduled for discussion in the coming months to help ensure the public
      safety services we provide the Emeryville community are competent and
      responsive to the needs of all community members. 


      I remain committed to creating a more just and equitable community. Black
      Lives Matter. Justice dies in silence. I promise to continue using my
      platform and voice to advance justice for everyone in our community.

      Livable communities promote local-hire, local-serving retail and services
      while helping to reopen businesses safely for customers and workers.
    text: >-
      Like many residents, I am committed to supporting local establishments
      grappling with the harsh impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Doing what we
      all can to keep our businesses afloat is a necessary part of supporting
      not just our local economy, but our community’s identity and diversity..
      The owners and employees of these places contribute significantly to the
      vibrancy of our community. The ability to “shop local” is part of creating
      a sustainable, family-friendly Emeryville for residents and visitors
      alike.


      These new economic challenges, and the uncertainty that lies ahead, calls
      for innovation and leadership. Over the last few years, I have supported
      and voted to approve over $200,000 for our Facade Grant program to assist
      businesses with infrastructure improvements - one of the most
      cost-prohibitive expenses to small businesses. I’ve introduced rebate
      programs for cabaret licenses that allow on-site music and entertainment
      and pushed for the city council to provide small businesses with tenant
      protections against eviction by commercial landlords while guaranteeing
      repayment opportunities. I partnered with our artist community to win a
      Cultural Arts District designation from the California Arts Council and as
      Mayor in 2018, I picked up and dusted off the old plans for the Emeryville
      Arts Center and commenced a public process that helped the city find a
      private partnership to help move our community arts center to
      construction. 


      Going forward, I will continue to identify opportunities and programs the
      city council can implement to help small businesses get back online
      quickly and safely, while working to preserve those cultural components
      that make Emeryville unique.
  - title: TRANSPORTATION, MOBILITY, AND TRANSIT
    id: transpo
    subtitle: >-
      Working to ensure equitable access to, from, and within Emeryville for
      pedestrians, bicyclists, families with children, the elderly,  people
      living with disabilities, and the transit-dependent.
    text: >-
      Emeryville’s geographic location makes it a natural transit hub in the Bay
      Area. Developing a multi-modal system that gives commuters meaningful
      choices can make our community safer. 


      As vice chair of the Alameda County Transportation Commission, I work to
      ensure transit remains accessible to people of all ages, incomes and
      abilities. I have prioritized infrastructure investments that target
      Alameda County’s high-injury network – intersections where higher
      incidents of bicycle and pedestrian injuries occur. I helped secure state
      funding to upgrade our city’s at-grade railroad crossings to improve
      pedestrian safety while also enhancing community livability with a rail
      quiet zone. I proposed a plan council has approved to redesign 40th Street
      with dedicated transit lanes, a protected cycle-track, and pedestrian
      enhancements. I am committed to turning our slow streets project along
      Doyle Street into a permanent installation so that families and children
      can safely enjoy the Emeryville Greenway and its adjacent park space. I am
      working closely with Caltrans, AC Transit and MTC to develop a bus-only
      on-ramp at Powell Street that will expedite trans-bay commutes across the
      Bay Bridge.


      I will continue to be a leader on transit equity, to leverage regional and
      state funding for local projects, and prioritize projects for investment
      that yield safe streets for our residents, businesses, and visitors.
