      We Continue to be Regional Leaders on Affordable Housing & Homelessness
      Services
    text: >-
      The cost of housing in Emeryville, like most of the state, is unaffordable
      for the average working household. Home ownership in California is at an
      all-time low and many families are spending over 50% of their monthly
      income on rent alone. Addressing the shortage of affordable housing and
      ending homelessness are my top priority as your councilmember.


      In 2018, Emeryville voters overwhelmingly approved Measure C, a $50
      million affordable housing bond to fund new affordable housing production
      and preserve existing affordable housing within our city. The bond
      proceeds will be used to implement the city's [Affordable Housing
      Expenditure
      Plan](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/13878/APPROVED-Resolution-No-21-13?bidId=){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Measure C funds will leverage millions
      more in county, state and federal dollars for affordable housing
      investment, allowing Emeryville to produce affordable housing while only
      paying a fraction of the overall cost.


      Emeryville has affordable housing dedicated to people experiencing
      homelessness, working families, seniors on fixed incomes, artists and
      transition-aged youth leaving foster care coming online in the next few
      years as a result of Emeryville voters commitment to being part of the
      solution. In April 2023, [Governor Newsom and the California Department of
      Housing and Community Development
      announced](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2023/04/05/governor-newsom-announces-11-new-jurisdictions-to-receive-a-prohousing-designation-for-accelerating-housing-production/){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that Emeryville had received a rare
      pro-housing designation from the state, making it eligible to be the first
      to receive funding for new affordable housing projects.


      In 2017, the City Council also approved a [Tenant Protection and Just
      Cause Eviction
      Ordinance](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Emeryville/#!/Emeryville05/Emeryville0540.html#5%E2%80%9040){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that provides tenants across the city with
      additional rights and remedies. Along with our [Smoking Pollution Control
      Ordinance](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Emeryville/html/Emeryville05/Emeryville0529.html#5-29.09){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 2018, the Council has been busy
      providing protections to homeowners and renters alike to ensure housing in
      our city is safe, livable, and healthy.


      While homelessness continues to rise in the Bay Area and across the state,
      due in large part to inadequate housing supply and affordability levels,
      Emeryville is not just providing housing to address the problem, but also
      providing compassionate shelter plus service care to our unhoused
      neighbors. In the [2022 Point-In-Time
      Count](https://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Emeryville-PIT-2022-Infographic-Report.pdf){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} conducted by Alameda County, Emeryville
      was one of the few cities that successfully decreased homelessness.

    subtitle: Building a Multi-Modal City for All Ages & Abilities
    text: >-
      Emeryville’s geographic location makes it a natural transit hub in the Bay
      Area. Developing a safe multi-modal system that serves all ages and
      abilities means more choices and greater livability for everyone.


      As a member of the Emeryville Transportation Committee, I have worked to
      bring traffic calming to residential neighborhoods, including the [Doyle
      Street neighborhood project](https://vimeo.com/540312226){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that included block closures near parks
      and playgrounds and car removal from southbound lanes. I championed the
      [Railroad Safety Improvement/Quiet Zone
      Project](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1429/Quiet-Zone-Project){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that will finish construction in 2023 and

      target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 2022.


      In 2022, I was elected Chair of the &nbsp;Alameda County Transportation
      Commission, where I have used my position to develop the county's first
      [Race & Equity Action
      Plan](https://www.alamedactc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AlamedaCTC_REAP_2022_Final.pdf){:

      action into the transportation planning of the future.


      Other local projects in the works include the city's plan for [a complete

      the Emeryville Greenway in 2023, and a left-turn bus-only on-ramp to I-80
      Westbound from Powell Street in partnership with MTC.


      In 2023, the Mayors Institute named me to their Inaugural [Mayors
      Institute on Pedestrian
      Safety](https://mayorsinnovation.org/our-work/mips/){: target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"}, along with 8 other mayors across the United States. I
      will continue to be a leader on transit equity, to leverage regional and
      state funding for local projects, and prioritize projects for investment
      that yield safe streets for our residents, businesses, and visitors.

    subtitle: Community Safety with a Commitment to Social Justice
    text: >-
      Community safety is critical to everything we do. This is accomplished
      through a combination of policies that reflect preparedness, a qualified
      and trained team of public safety professionals, and policies that balance
      the civil rights of marginalized community members against government
      overreach.


      Since joining the city council, I have fought to protect the safety of our
      most vulnerable community members. My first act as a council member in
      2017 was to coauthor the city’s Sanctuary City resolution. I have
      identified and pushed the city to end contracts with companies sharing
      personal and biometric data with ICE and have called for limits on the use
      of certain technologies like facial recognition that can be misused to
      target and discriminate against minorities. True community safety comes
      from making meaningful investments in community-based health, education,
      and youth programs.


      Preparedness is also a key part of our safety plan. In 2023, the
      Emeryville City Council fully funded a $5 Million Disaster Reserve Fund,
      fulfilling a citywide goal that I've pushed for us to complete during my
      tenure in office.


      In 2022, the City Council voted to eliminate many of the old criminal
      offenses enumerated in the Municipal Code, ensuring that our law
      enforcement personnel and resources are available and used at calls for
      service that most directly impact community safety while also eliminating
      pretextual reasons for a police stop.&nbsp;


      The safest communities are those that promote inclusivity, justice, and
      safety for everyone. I will always work to promote a safe and just
      Emeryville community for all.

    subtitle: Creating a Financially Healthy City for Our Future
    text: >-
      Emeryville continues to be a model city for fiscal responsibility and
      economic development. Whether it be an economic recession, a housing
      crisis, or a pandemic, the city has been able to withstand successive
      economic challenges by adopting solid fiscal policies, implementing
      healthy budget principles, and diversifying our local economy's tax base
      to protect critical services residents and businesses rely on.


      In 2018, residents approved both [Measure
      C](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1204/Measure-C-Emeryville-Affordable-Housing-){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a $50 million affordable housing bond
      which served as an investment in equitable housing opportunities, as well
      as [Measure
      S](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1191/Cannabis-Business-Information){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a progressive tax on cannabis that
      incentivized some of the state's best cannabis businesses to relocate to
      Emeryville for manufacturing and distribution. In 2020, voters approved
      [Measure
      F](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/12482/EmeryvilleCI1_TBWB_Notice_2?bidId=){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which provided critical resources to
      support affordable child care in the city, as well as public safety
      staffing and a citywide Code Enforcement Officer. In 2022, voters approved
      [Measure
      O](https://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/1443/Measure-O---Real-Property-Transfer-Tax){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which helps us do environmental projects,
      preserve parks and playgrounds, and funds a Critical Needs Fund that can
      be used to address unplanned or emergency needs in the city as they arise.


      When the COVID pandemic struck, the city moved to convert our facade grant
      program for new businesses modifying old buildings into a temporary rental
      assistance program for small, minority owned businesses. I worked with
      colleagues and staff to develop a parklet program that made [converting
      on-street parking spaces into permanent outdoor
      dining](https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/05/06/emeryville-cooking-up-permanent-outdoor-dining-plans/){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;without fees a possibility for small
      business and restaurant owners. I've partnered with small, local business
      leaders to start up our BizNexus Program as well as large corporate
      partners for environmental community clean-up events.


      I will continue to look for ways to protect the city’s core services, to
      expand and diversify our local economy, and to support the businesses and
      workers that make up our local economy.

      Livable communities promote local-hire, local-serving retail and services
      while helping to reopen businesses safely for customers and workers.

      Like many residents, I am committed to supporting local establishments
      grappling with the harsh impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Doing what we
      all can to keep our businesses afloat is a necessary part of supporting
      not just our local economy, but our community’s identity and diversity..
      The owners and employees of these places contribute significantly to the
      vibrancy of our community. The ability to “shop local” is part of creating
      a sustainable, family-friendly Emeryville for residents and visitors
      alike.


      These new economic challenges, and the uncertainty that lies ahead, calls
      for innovation and leadership. Over the last few years, I have supported
      and voted to approve over $200,000 for our Facade Grant program to assist
      businesses with infrastructure improvements - one of the most
      cost-prohibitive expenses to small businesses. I’ve introduced rebate
      programs for cabaret licenses that allow on-site music and entertainment
      and pushed for the city council to provide small businesses with tenant
      protections against eviction by commercial landlords while guaranteeing
      repayment opportunities. I partnered with our artist community to win a
      Cultural Arts District designation from the California Arts Council and as
      Mayor in 2018, I picked up and dusted off the old plans for the Emeryville
      Arts Center and commenced a public process that helped the city find a
      private partnership to help move our community arts center to
      construction.


      Going forward, I will continue to identify opportunities and programs the
      city council can implement to help small businesses get back online
      quickly and safely, while working to preserve those cultural components
      that make Emeryville unique.
