about: "![John Bauters at a firehouse](../img/john-firehouse.jpg)\n\nJohn Bauters
  is a progressive leader serving on the Emeryville Council since 2016. John brings
  a combination of professional and lived experience in addressing many of the issues
  facing residents in the East Bay to his role as a council member.\n\nJohn has been
  fighting the structural and societal causes of poverty for over 15 years. A former
  disaster relief director and tenant attorney, he currently works as a public policy
  expert on the issues of homelessness, criminal justice reform, and community-based
  mental health services.\n\nAs a legal aid attorney, John represented over 2,500
  people and families experiencing homelessness, facing eviction, or living with a
  disability in a wide array of legal matters. During his time in practice, John fought
  the institutional and corporate structures that perpetuate poverty, entrench racism,
  and deprive vulnerable community members of justice. He mentored or supervised dozens
  of young and aspiring civil rights attorneys looking to make their communities more
  just and equitable throughout his tenure as a defense litigator.\n\nIn his work
  as a criminal justice reform and housing policy expert, John has helped craft and
  pass over two dozen pieces of state legislation here in California that have diverted
  state funding from the prison industry complex by reinvesting those funds into education,
  mental health and substance use disorder programs, and trauma-informed services.
  John has twice been selected by the Board of State and Community Corrections to serve
  on Executive Steering Committees that reinvest state resources into community-based
  safety solutions.\n\nSince being elected to the Emeryville City Council, John has
  been a bold, progressive voice on a number of issues in the region. Under his leadership,
  the city council has terminated contracts with subcontractors receiving data-sharing
  grants from ICE and become a sanctuary city. When the Emery Unified School Board
  proposed putting police in Emeryville’s schools, John leveraged his experience in
  restorative justice and alternatives to police to help defeat the proposal.\n\nJohn’s
  leadership on housing is evident. In 2018, as the city’s mayor, John championed
  Measure C, a $50 million affordable housing bond that will leverage additional regional,
  state and federal dollars to build hundreds of new affordable housing units for
  very low-income families, seniors on fixed incomes, artists, and people experiencing
  homelessness here in Emeryville. Since Measure C’s approval, two new 100% affordable
  projects are already in the design review process.\n\nOn homelessness, John partnered
  with leaders in Oakland to help deliver services and transitional housing assistance
  to a large encampment behind the Home Depot while simultaneously converting Emeryville’s
  old Rec Center into a family shelter for homeless families with children. John has
  always worked to deliver regional solutions built on the notion that community transformation
  happens when leadership uses people-centered decision-making and is solutions-oriented.
  Much of his work on the issue comes from his own personal experience with housing
  insecurity as an LGBTQ youth and many years of outreach work with people experiencing
  homelessness.\n\nAs Emeryville’s only openly-LGBTQ councilmember, John has been
  a leader in the East Bay on civil rights, and made Emeryville a beacon for those
  seeking an inclusive community to call home. John introduced “Emeryville Community
  Celebrations” during his tenure as mayor, recognizing local leaders and heroes that
  make our city a diverse and inclusive community.\n\nJohn has also helped make Emeryville
  a regional leader on transit equity. As vice chair of the Alameda County Transportation
  Commission, John has used his position of leadership to prioritize the principles
  of Vision Zero, working to make streets safe for all users. Locally, he has pushed
  for additional protected bike lanes and pedestrian enhancements, while prioritizing
  the introduction of transit-only lanes AC Transit and Emery-Go-Round routes to make
  those services more efficient for riders. \n\nThe Alameda County Mayors Conference
  selected John to represent Alameda County’s cities at the Bay Area Air Quality Management
  District. There, John chairs the Stationary Source Committee, which works to regulate
  large industrial polluters and reduce toxic emissions. Calling environmental justice
  a form of racial justice, John championed the creation of the District’s first-ever
  Committee on Equity, Access and Inclusion, which reviews District policies and proposals
  through the lens of the communities most-impacted by pollution.\n\nJohn received
  his Bachelor’s Degree in Government and Psychology from the University of Notre
  Dame and his Juris Doctor in law from Boston College Law School. He volunteers at
  the Emeryville Citizen’s Assistance Program (ECAP) and is a member of the Temescal
  Creek Community Organic Garden, both here in Emeryville. It’s not uncommon to find
  him out for a walk with his dog, Reyna, or on a bike ride along the Bay Trail.\n\n###
